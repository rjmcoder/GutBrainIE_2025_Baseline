        "abstract": "(1) Background: studies have shown that some patients experience mental deterioration after bariatric surgery. (2) Methods: We examined whether the use of probiotics and improved eating habits can improve the mental health of people who suffered from mood disorders after bariatric surgery. We also analyzed patients' mental states, eating habits and microbiota. (3) Results: Depressive symptoms were observed in 45% of 200 bariatric patients. After 5 weeks, we noted an improvement in patients' mental functioning (reduction in BDI and HRSD), but it was not related to the probiotic used. The consumption of vegetables and whole grain cereals increased (DQI-I adequacy), the consumption of simple sugars and SFA decreased (moderation DQI-I), and the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids increased it. In the feces of patients after RYGB, there was a significantly higher abundance of two members of the Muribaculaceae family, namely Veillonella and Roseburia, while those after SG had more Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Subdoligranulum, Oscillibacter, and UCG-005. (4) Conclusions: the noted differences in the composition of the gut microbiota (RYGB vs. SG) may be one of the determinants of the proper functioning of the gut-brain microbiota axis, although there is currently a need for further research into this topic using a larger group of patients and different probiotic doses."

        "abstract": "The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health and has placed pressure on the livestock industry to eliminate the use of antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) as feed additives. To mitigate their removal, efficacious alternatives are required. AGPs are thought to operate through modulating the gut microbiome to limit opportunities for colonization by pathogens, increase nutrient utilization, and reduce inflammation. However, little is known concerning the underlying mechanisms. Previous studies investigating the effects of AGPs on the poultry gut microbiome have largely focused on 16S rDNA surveys based on a single gastrointestinal (GI) site, diet, and/or timepoint, resulting in an inconsistent view of their impact on community composition. In this study, we perform a systematic investigation of both the composition and function of the chicken gut microbiome, in response to AGPs. Birds were raised under two different diets and AGP treatments, and 16S rDNA surveys applied to six GI sites sampled at three key timepoints of the poultry life cycle. Functional investigations were performed through metatranscriptomics analyses and metabolomics. Our study reveals a more nuanced view of the impact of AGPs, dependent on age of bird, diet, and intestinal site sampled. Although AGPs have a limited impact on taxonomic abundances, they do appear to redefine influential taxa that may promote the exclusion of other taxa. Microbiome expression profiles further reveal a complex landscape in both the expression and taxonomic representation of multiple pathways including cell wall biogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and several involved in energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Many AGP-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression likely serve to redirect metabolic flux with the potential to regulate bacterial growth or produce metabolites that impact the host. As alternative feed additives are developed to mimic the action of AGPs, our study highlights the need to ensure such alternatives result in functional changes that are consistent with site-, age-, and diet-associated taxa. The genes and pathways identified in this study are therefore expected to drive future studies, applying tools such as community-based metabolic modeling, focusing on the mechanistic impact of different dietary regimes on the microbiome. Consequently, the data generated in this study will be crucial for the development of next-generation feed additives targeting gut health and poultry production. Video Abstract."

Recent studies suggest a direct link with mental health through bidirectional gut-brain pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that the composition and/or function of intestinal microbiome differs in those with psychosis and schizophrenia as compared with controls. There is relatively little research on the predicted or actual functional alterations associated with the composition of oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis. We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify, evaluate and if possible, combine the published literature on compositional alterations in the oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis or schizophrenia compared with healthy controls.

Quantitative analyses will be performed using random-effects meta-analyses to calculate mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. <b>Discussion:</b> Changes in microbiota composition in psychosis and schizophrenia have been correlated with alternations in brain structure and function, altered immunity, altered metabolic pathways and symptom severity. Changes have also been identified as potential biomarkers for psychosis that might aid in diagnosis. Understanding how predicted or actual functional alterations in microbial genes or metabolic pathways influence symptomatic expression and downstream clinical outcomes may contribute to the development of microbiome targeted interventions for psychosis. <b>Registration:</b> The study is prospectively registered in PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021260208)."

This review presents an overview of the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function, especially with regard to migraine headache. Literature review. Anesthesia and Operation Center, Department of Anesthesiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital. The present investigation included a PubMed search using the following terms: migraine headache, gut microbiota, brain function, and probiotics. In this literature review, we mainly discussed the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function, especially with regard to migraine headache. The potential effects of probiotics supplement on migraine headache were also included. There is limited evidence from clinical studies of the positive effects of probiotics in patients with migraine headache. Large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of probiotics in patients with migraine headache. Similar to migraine headache, disorders of the brain involving depression and anxiety have been demonstrated to be associated with increased gut permeability. An improvement in gut microbiota and reduction of inflammation can have positive effects on strengthening gut and brain function. Moreover, it can be inferred that probiotics may have a beneficial effect on the frequency and severity of migraine headache attacks. Large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled studies are warranted in the future to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of probiotics in patients with migraine headache.Key words: Migraine headache, gut microbiota, brain function, probiotics."

We hypothesized that the gut microbiota shifts might also have an effect on cognitive functions in T1D. Herein we used a non-absorbable antibiotic vancomycin to modify the gut microbiota in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D mice and studied the impact of microbial changes on cognitive performances in T1D mice and its potential gut-brain neural mechanism. We found that vancomycin exposure disrupted the gut microbiome, altered host metabolic phenotypes, and facilitated cognitive impairment in T1D mice. Long-term acetate deficiency due to depletion of acetate-producing bacteria resulted in the reduction of synaptophysin (SYP) in the hippocampus as well as learning and memory impairments. Exogenous acetate supplement or fecal microbiota transplant recovered hippocampal SYP level in vancomycin-treated T1D mice, and this effect was attenuated by vagal inhibition or vagotomy. Our results demonstrate the protective role of microbiota metabolite acetate in cognitive functions and suggest long-term acetate deficiency as a risk factor of cognitive decline. Video Abstract."

Current research is increasingly focusing on the potential association between the microbiota and various neuropsychiatric disorders. The microbiota resides in various parts of the body, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, lungs, gut, skin, bladder, and vagina. The gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has received particular attention due to its high abundance and its potential role in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the microbiota presents in other body tissues, though less abundant, also plays crucial role in immune system and human homeostasis, thus influencing the development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, oral microbiota imbalance and associated periodontitis might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, studies using the postmortem brain samples have detected the widespread presence of oral bacteria in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This article provides an overview of the emerging role of the host microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and discusses future directions, such as underlying biological mechanisms, reliable biomarkers associated with the host microbiota, and microbiota-targeted interventions, for research in this field."

        "abstract": "Autoimmune (AI) diseases, which present in a multitude of systemic manifestations, have been connected to many underlying factors. These factors include the environment, genetics, individual microbiomes, and diet. An individual's gut microbiota is an integral aspect of human functioning, as it is intimately integrated into the metabolic, mechanical, immunological, and neurologic pathways of the body. The microbiota dynamically changes throughout our lifetimes and is individually unique. While the gut microbiome is ever-adaptive, gut dysbiosis can exert a significant influence on physical and mental health. Gut dysbiosis is a common factor in various AI, and diets with elevated fat and sugar content have been linked to gut microbiome alterations, contributing to increased systemic inflammation. Additionally, multiple AI's have increased levels of certain inflammatory markers such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-17 that have been shown to contribute to arthropathy and are also linked to increased levels of gut dysbiosis. While chronic inflammation has been shown to affect many physiologic systems, this review explores the connection between gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and the skeletal and joint destruction associated with various AI, including psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, irritable bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. This review aims to define the mechanisms of microbiome crosstalk between the cells of bone and cartilage, as well as to investigate the potential bidirectional connections between AI, bony and cartilaginous tissue, and the gut microbiome. By doing this, the review also introduces the concept of altering an individual's specific gut microbiota as a form of regenerative medicine and potential tailored therapy for joint destruction seen in AI. We hope to show multiple, specific ways to target the microbiome through diet changes, rebalancing microbial diversity, or decreasing specific microbes associated with increased gut permeability, leading to reduced systemic inflammation contributing to joint pathology. Additionally, we plan to show that diet alterations can promote beneficial changes in the gut microbiota, supporting the body's own endogenous processes to decrease inflammation and increase healing. This concept of microbial alteration falls under the definition of regenerative medicine and should be included accordingly. By implementing microbial alterations in regenerative medicine, this current study could lend increasing support to the current research on the associations of the gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and AI-related musculoskeletal pathology."

Here, we evaluated the effect of oral ingestion of live and inactivated Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661 on oleic acid-induced acne using a mouse model. Results indicated that live L. plantarum CCFM8661 suppressed skin inflammation and serum hormone (insulin and testosterone) production in acne mice. Parallelly, live L. plantarum CCFM8661 effectively reduced the formation of skin lipids (triglycerides and non-esterified free fatty acids), and normalized the expression of skin lipid metabolism-related genes (PPAR-\u03b3, SREBP-1c, ACC\u03b1, FASN, PPAR-\u03b1, ACOX1, HSL and ATGL).

Both live and inactivated L. plantarum CCFM8661 raised the richness of gut microbiota, reduced the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes and decreased the relative abundance of Staphylococcus in the feces of acne mice. Oral ingestion of L. plantarum CCFM8661, particularly live cells, could alleviate acne by suppressing skin inflammation, normalizing the metabolism of hormones and skin lipids, which may be achieved by improving the gut microbial ecosystem. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."

In this review, we focus on the molecular underpinning of senescence and neurodegeneration related to age-associated brain diseases, in particular, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, along with introducing nutrients or phytochemicals that modulate age-associated molecular dysfunctions, potentially offering preventive or therapeutic benefits. Based on current knowledge, the dysregulation of microglia genes and neuroinflammation, telomere attrition, neuronal stem cell degradation, vascular system dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, loss of chromosome X inactivation in females, and gut microbiome dysbiosis have been seen to play pivotal roles in neurodegeneration in an interactive manner. There are several phytochemicals (e.g., curcumin, EGCG, fucoidan, galangin, astin C, apigenin, resveratrol, phytic acid, acacetin, daucosterol, silibinin, sulforaphane, withaferin A, and betulinic acid) that modulate the dysfunction of one or several key genes (e.g., TREM2, C3, C3aR1, TNFA, NF-kb, TGFB1&2, SIRT1&6, HMGB1, and STING) affected in the aged brain. Although phytochemicals have shown promise in slowing down the progression of age-related brain diseases, more studies to identify their efficacy, alone or in combinations, in preclinical systems can help to design novel nutritional strategies for the management of neurodegenerative diseases in humans."

        "year": "2023",
        "abstract": "Melanin, a ubiquitous dark pigment, plays important roles in the immune system, including scavenging reactive oxygen species formed in response to ultraviolet radiation absorption, absorbing metals, thermal regulation, drug uptake, innate immune system functions, redox, and energy transduction. Many tissue types, including brain, heart, arteries, ovaries, and others, contain melanin. Almost all cells contain precursors to melanin. A growing number of diseases in which there is a loss of melanin and/or neuromelanin are increasingly thought to have infectious etiologies, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and vitiligo. AD, PD, LBD, and vitiligo have been linked with herpesvirus, which enters melanosomes and causes apoptosis, and with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Herpesvirus is also linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We theorize that under normal healthy states, melanin retains some of the energy it absorbs from electromagnetic radiation, which is then used to fuel cells, and energy from ATP is used to compliment that energy supply. We further theorize that loss of melanin reduces the energy supply of cells, which in the case of AD, PD, and LBD results in an inability to sustain immune system defenses and remove the plaques associated with the disease, which appear to be part of the immune system's attempt to eradicate the pathogens seen in these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an attempt to explain why removing these plaques does not result in improvements in cognition and mood and why cognitions and moods in these individuals have ebbs and flows, we postulate that it is not the plaques that cause the cognitive symptoms but, rather, inflammation in the brain resulting from the immune system's response to pathogens. Our theory that energy retained in melanin fuels cells in an inverse relationship with ATP is supported by studies showing alterations in ATP production in relationship to melanin levels in melanomas, vitiligo, and healthy cells. Therefore, alteration of melanin levels may be at the core of many diseases. We propose regulating melanin levels may offer new avenues for treatment development."

Herein, we determined the potential functions of the flavonoid-enriched fraction from Seabuckthorn, which was named SBF, in treating major depressive disorder in mice. In the CUMS-induced mouse model, the intake of SBF reversed their depressive behaviors and relieved the CUMS-disturbed levels of neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, stress-related hormones, and inflammation-related cytokines. Additionally, the treatment of depressive mice with SBF showed ability to regulate the gut microbiota, especially in decreasing the abundance of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, while increasing the abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> at the family level.

Most common neuroactive compounds in foods are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, melatonin, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, tryptamine, tyramine and \u03b2-phenylethylamine. Fermented foods contain some of these compounds, which can affect human health and mood. Moreover, food processing such as roasting and malting alter amount and profile of neuroactive compounds in foods. In addition to plant-origin and microbially-formed neuroactive compounds in foods, these substances are also formed by gut microbiota, which is the most attractive subject to assess the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health. The discovery of microbiota-gut-brain axis calls for the investigation of the effects of diet on the formation of neuroactive compounds in the gut. Furthermore, probiotics and prebiotics are indispensable elements for the understanding of the food-mood relationship. The focus of this comprehensive review is to investigate the neuroactive compounds found naturally in foods or formed during fermentation.

Maternal prenatal exposure measures collected during the third trimester included the faecal microbiota (generated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing), and dietary intake. The behavioural outcome used the Childhood Behaviour Checklist at age two. Models were adjusted for prenatal diet, smoking, perceived stress, maternal age and sample batch. We found evidence that the alpha diversity of the maternal faecal microbiota during the third trimester of pregnancy predicts child internalising behaviour at two years of age (-2\u00b774, (-4\u00b771, -0\u00b778), p\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b701 (Wald test), R<sup>2</sup>=0\u00b707). Taxa from butyrate-producing families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, were more abundant in mothers of children with normative behaviour. A healthy prenatal diet indirectly related to decreased child internalising behaviours via higher alpha diversity of maternal faecal microbiota.

Thirteen lactic acid bacterial strains, belonging to the species Levilactobacillus brevis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus thermophilus, were characterised for their in vitro ability to produce neurotransmitters. L. brevis P30021 and L. plantarum P30025 were selected based on their capability to produce \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine in vitro. A probiotic formulation with potential psychobiotic activity was prepared and tested in a batch culture of human microbiota monitoring the formation of GABA and acetylcholine. Samples of the three colonic tracts were taken from the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbiota (SHIME\u00ae) evaluating the production of GABA and other neurotransmitters by LC-MS. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by GC and microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also determined. Probiotic supplementation led to the formation of GABA and acetylcholine with a decrease in glutamate concentrations in the in vitro batch fermentation. Production of GABA after the treatment with probiotics was confirmed in the SHIME\u00ae short-term experiment. No differences in short-chain fatty acids were observed up to 72\u00a0h of fermentation. Different microbiota composition was found in the three different parts of the colon, with a higher abundance of Veillonellaceae in the ascending colon vessels. The probiotic-exposed microbiota showed higher levels of Bacteroides, a gut microbe associated with anti-inflammatory activities and a potential GABA producer. Results demonstrate the impact of the tested probiotic formula on gut microbiota structure and GABA production. In conclusion, the probiotic treatment changed the microbiota composition and increased neuroactive metabolites production, indicating promising potential as psychobiotics, even if further clinical evidence is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these probiotics in improving mental health."

Additionally, significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, and <i>Fecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were identified in the fecal metagenomes of the probiotic group, while the abundances of SGBs representing the species <i>Roseburia faecis</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</i> decreased significantly (<i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, the 12-week probiotic supplementation enhanced the diversity of neurotransmitter-synthesizing/consuming SGBs and the levels of some predicted microbial neuroactive metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, arachidonic acid, and sphingomyelin). Our results showed a potential link between probiotic-induced gut microbiota modulation and stress/anxiety alleviation in stressed adults, supporting that the gut-brain axis was involved in relieving stress-related symptoms. The beneficial effect relied not only on microbial diversity changes but more importantly gut metagenome modulations at the SGB and functional gene levels."

        "abstract": "Recent work has established that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have an altered gut microbiome, along with signs of intestinal inflammation. This could help explain the high degree of gastric disturbances in PD patients, as well as potentially be linked to the migration of peripheral inflammatory factors into the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine microbiome alteration prior to the induction of a PD murine model. We presently assessed whether pre-treatment with the probiotic, VSL #3, or the inflammatory inducer, dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), would influence the PD-like pathology provoked by a dual hit toxin model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and paraquat exposure. While VSL #3 has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects, DSS is often used as a model of colitis because of the gut inflammation and the breach of the intestinal barrier that it induces. We found that VSL#3 did not have any significant effects (beyond a blunting of LPS paraquat-induced weight loss). However, the DSS treatment caused marked changes in the gut microbiome and was also associated with augmented behavioral and inflammatory outcomes. In fact, DSS markedly increased taxa belonging to the Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families but reduced those from Rikencellaceae and S24-7, as well as provoking colonic pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, consistent with an inflamed gut. The DSS also increased the impact of LPS plus paraquat upon microglial morphology, along with circulating lipocalin-2 (neutrophil marker) and IL-6. Yet, neither DSS nor VSL#3 influenced the loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons or the astrocytic and cytoskeleton remodeling protein changes that were provoked by the LPS followed by paraquat treatment. These data suggest that disruption of the intestinal integrity and the associated microbiome can interact with systemic inflammatory events to promote widespread brain-gut changes that could be relevant for PD and at the very least, suggestive of novel neuro-immune communication."

        "abstract": "The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders."

The behaviors were studied by forced swimming test, open field test, sucrose preference test, and body weight. Products of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, neurotransmitter, and serum cytokines were investigated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrocyte, was quantified using immunofluorescence. Microbiota culturing in vitro after XPJYF treatment was analyze by 16\u2009s RNA sequencing technology. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic activated rat primary astrocyte in vitro. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cytokines, and oxidative stress factors were determined by western blotting, and glycometabolism in astrocyte was investigated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) kits. Microbiota composition during 8\u00a0mg/ml of XPJYF (H12-8) for 12\u2009h showed the more consistency. Lactococcus is enriched in DD-derived microbiota composition, and Biffdobacterium and Lactobacillus in H12-8 group. GLUCOSE1PMETAB-PWY and PWY-7328 of which biofunctions were dominantly encoded by Biffdobacterium were the top two of altered pathways. XPJYF improved behaviors and repressed astrocyte activation in depression rats. XPJYF elevated 2-DG uptake, ATP, glucose-1-phosphate, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inhibited cytokines and oxidative stress in LPS-induced astrocyte. XPJYF treatment targets inflammation, activation, and glycometabolim in astrocyte via gut microbiota modulation, thereby improve animal behaviors, HPA axis dysfunction, and neurotransmitter synthesis in depression rats."

Moreover, the microbiota distinctly changed from the non-stress group and was characterized by highly diverse bacterial communities associated with significant reductions in <i>Lactobacillus</i> species. Probiotics attenuated CMS-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, significantly increased <i>Lactobacillus</i> abundance, and reversed the CMS-induced immune changes in the hippocampus. Thus, the possible mechanism involved in the antidepressant-like activity of probiotics is correlated with <i>Lactobacillus</i> species via the gut microbiota-inflammation-brain axis."

This review examines the importance of intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs, aiming to elucidate the distinct characteristics and variations in the composition between these two species. In humans, the intestinal microbiota contributes to several crucial physiological processes, including digestion, nutrient absorption, immune system development, and modulation of host metabolism. Dysbiosis, an imbalance or disruption of the gut microbial community, has been linked to various disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and even neurological conditions. Furthermore, recent research has unveiled the profound influence of the gut-brain axis, emphasizing the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, impacting cognitive function and mental health. Similarly, alterations in the canine intestinal microbiota have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic enteropathy, such as inflammatory bowel disease, food allergies, and ulcerative histiocytic colitis. However, our understanding of the intricacies and functional significance of the intestinal microbiota in dogs remains limited. Understanding the complex dynamics of the intestinal microbiota in both humans and dogs is crucial for devising effective strategies to promote health and manage disease. Moreover, exploring the similarities and differences in the gut microbial composition between these two species can facilitate translational research, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic interventions and strategies to enhance the well-being of both humans and dogs."

Here, we propose that the differences in structure and composition of IBS-D and depression gut microbiota give rise to different downstream functions, which lead to distinct clinical phenotypes <i>via</i> host metabolism and further influence the interaction of brain-gut axis. We performed multiomics study, including fecal metagenome-wide sequencing and serum metabolomics profiling in 65 individuals with IBS-D (n=22), depression (n=15), comorbid patients (n=13), and healthy controls (n=15). We analyzed functional genes contributed by the primary genus and evaluated their correlations with clinical indices and host metabolites. Metagenomic analysis revealed 26 clusters of orthologous groups of protein (COG) categories consisting of a total of 4,631 functional genes. Trehalose and maltose hydrolase (COG1554) and fucose permease (COG0738) were the most relevant and enriched functional genes in the IBS-D patients; urease accessory proteins UreE (COG2371) was that in the depression patients. Context based genome annotation suggest that an alteration of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> in IBS-D and depression respectively may be responsible for the enrichment described above. Correlation with host metabolites, such as maltotriose and isomaltose in carbohydrate metabolism and anandamide in neuroactive metabolism, drew further connections between these findings. These changes led us to propose a connection between genomic signatures and clinical differences observed in IBS-D and depression.

We investigated the contribution of the maternal microbiota to the microbiota of infant gut and nose in the context of mode of delivery and feeding. Using 16S rRNA sequencing and specific qPCR, we profiled microbiota of 42 mother-infant pairs from the GUSTO birth cohort, at body sites including maternal vagina, rectum and skin; and infant stool and nose. In our study, overlap between maternal vaginal microbiota and infant faecal microbiota was minimal, while the similarity between maternal rectal microbiota and infant microbiota was more pronounced. However, an infant's nasal and gut microbiota were no more similar to that of its own mother, than to that of unrelated mothers. These findings were independent of delivery mode. We conclude that the transfer of maternal vaginal microbes play a minor role in seeding infant stool microbiota. Transfer of maternal rectal microbiota could play a larger role in seeding infant stool microbiota, but approaches other than the generally used analyses of community similarity measures are likely to be needed to quantify bacterial transmission. We confirmed the clear difference between microbiota of infants born by Caesarean section compared to vaginally delivered infants and the impact of feeding mode on infant gut microbiota. Only vaginally delivered, fully breastfed infants had gut microbiota dominated by Bifidobacteria. Our data suggest that reduced transfer of maternal vaginal microbial is not the main mechanism underlying the differential infant microbiota composition associated with Caesarean delivery. The sources of a large proportion of infant microbiota could not be identified in maternal microbiota, and the sources of seeding of infant gut and nasal microbiota remain to be elucidated."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most intensively studied neurodegenerative disease in this context. In this review, we performed a systematic evaluation of the published literature comparing changes in colonic microbiome in PD to the ones observed in other NDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To enhance the comparability of different studies, only human case-control studies were included. Several studies showed an increase of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, Verrucomicrobiaceae and <i>Akkermansia</i> in PD. A decrease of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> spp., <i>Coprococcus</i> spp., <i>Blautia</i> spp., <i>Prevotella</i> spp. and Prevotellaceae was observed in PD. On a low taxonomic resolution, like the phylum level, the changes are not disease-specific and are inconsistent. However, on a higher taxonomic resolution like genus or species level, a minor overlap was observed between PD and MSA, both alpha synucleinopathies. We show that standardization of sample collection and analysis is necessary for ensuring the reproducibility and comparability of data. We also provide evidence that assessing the microbiota composition at high taxonomic resolution reveals changes in relative abundance that may be specific to or characteristic of one disease or disease group, and might evolve discriminative power. The interactions between bacterial species and strains and the co-abundances must be investigated before assumptions about the effects of specific bacteria on the host can be made with certainty."

Industrialized nations especially, have experienced a marked decrease in dietary fiber intake, but the potential mechanism linking low fiber intake and cognitive impairment is poorly understood. Emerging research reported that the diversity of gut microbiota in Western populations is significantly reduced. However, it is unknown whether a fiber-deficient diet (which alters gut microbiota) could impair cognition and brain functional elements through the gut-brain axis. In this study, a mouse model of long-term (15 weeks) dietary fiber deficiency (FD) was used to mimic a sustained low fiber intake in humans. We found that FD mice showed impaired cognition, including deficits in object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to perform daily living activities. The hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure was damaged in FD mice, characterized by widened synaptic clefts and thinned postsynaptic densities. A hippocampal proteomic analysis further identified a deficit of CaMKIId and its associated synaptic proteins (including GAP43 and SV2C) in the FD mice, along with neuroinflammation and microglial engulfment of synapses. The FD mice also exhibited gut microbiota dysbiosis (decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria), which was significantly associated with the cognitive deficits. Of note, a rapid differentiating microbiota change was observed in the mice with a short-term FD diet (7 days) before cognitive impairment, highlighting a possible causal impact of the gut microbiota profile on cognitive outcomes. Moreover, the FD diet compromised the intestinal barrier and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We exploit these findings for SCFA receptor knockout mice and oral SCFA supplementation that verified SCFA playing a critical role linking the altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment. This study, for the first time, reports that a fiber-deprived diet leads to cognitive impairment through altering the gut microbiota-hippocampal axis, which is pathologically distinct from normal brain aging. These findings alert the adverse impact of dietary fiber deficiency on brain function, and highlight an increase in fiber intake as a nutritional strategy to reduce the risk of developing diet-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

Patients with PTSD are also at a higher risk for comorbidities. However, it is not well understood how PTSD affects human health and/or promotes the risk for comorbidities. Nevertheless, patients with PTSD harbor a proinflammatory milieu and dysbiotic gut microbiota. Gut barrier integrity helps to maintain normal gut homeostasis and its dysregulation promotes gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We used a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress (RSDS), a preclinical model of PTSD. Behavioral studies, metagenomics analysis of the microbiome, gut permeability assay (on mouse colon, using an Ussing chamber), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Polarized intestinal epithelial cells and 3-dimensional crypt cultures were used for mechanistic analysis. The RSDS mice harbor a heightened proinflammatory gut environment and microbiota dysbiosis. The RSDS mice further showed significant dysregulation of gut barrier functions, including transepithelial electrical resistance, mucin homeostasis, and antimicrobial responses. RSDS mice also showed a specific increase in intestinal expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein, and epinephrine, a stress-induced neurotransmitter. Treating intestinal epithelial cells or 3-dimensional cultured crypts with norepinephrine or intestinal luminal contents (fecal contents) upregulated claudin-2 expression and inhibited transepithelial electrical resistance. Traumatic stress induces dysregulation of gut barrier functions, which may underlie the observed gut microbiota changes and proinflammatory gut milieu, all of which may have an interdependent effect on the health and increased risk of comorbidities in patients with PTSD."

This paper reviews these connections and provides a context by which multiple risk factors for schizophrenia may be related. Epidemiological studies strongly link schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders including enteropathic celiac disease. Exposure to wheat gluten and bovine milk casein also contribute to non-celiac food sensitivities in susceptible individuals. Co-morbid GI inflammation accompanies humoral immunity to food antigens, occurs early during the course of schizophrenia and appears to be independent from antipsychotic-generated motility effects. This inflammation impacts endothelial barrier permeability and can precipitate translocation of gut bacteria into systemic circulation. Infection by the neurotropic gut pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, will elicit an inflammatory GI environment. Such processes trigger innate immunity, including activation of complement C1q, which also functions at synapses in the brain. The emerging field of microbiome research lies at the center of these interactions with evidence that the abundance and diversity of resident gut microbiota contribute to digestion, inflammation, gut permeability and behavior. Dietary modifications of core bacterial compositions may explain inefficient gluten digestion and how immigrant status in certain situations is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Gut microbiome research in schizophrenia is in its infancy, but data in related fields suggest disease-associated altered phylogenetic compositions. In summary, this review surveys associative and experimental data linking autoimmunity, GI activity and schizophrenia, and proposes that understanding of disrupted biological pathways outside of the brain can lend valuable information regarding pathogeneses of complex, polygenic brain disorders."

Among women who received an antibiotic during pregnancy, flu in trimester two was not associated with ASD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.99 [0.43-2.28]). Among women who were not exposed to an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy, flu in second trimester was significantly associated with increased odds of ASD (aOR = 4.05 [1.14-14.38], P = .03), after adjustment for child sex, child birth year, maternal age, gestational age, C-section delivery, and low birthweight. These findings should be treated as hypothesis-generating and suggest that antibiotic use may modify the influence that MIA has on autism risk in the child. LAY SUMMARY: We looked at whether the association between activation of the immune system during pregnancy and risk of the child developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differed among women who did or did not take an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy. We examined 116 children with ASD and 860 without ASD and found that flu in second trimester was associated with increased ASD, but only among women who did not take an antibiotic during pregnancy. No other immune activation exposures seemed to interact with antibiotic use."

        "abstract": "In recent decades, the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of the microbiome changes and the impact of probiotic supplementation have increased rapidly. However, the potential for clinical translation of microbiome research for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders is unclear. This review examined available evidence related to gut microbiota as well as the impact of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in the pediatric population reported to date. We performed a literature search for the gut microbiota in child and adolescent population (0-18\u00a0years old) with mental health disorders from July 1999 through July 2019 in several databases: ClinicalTrials.gov, Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 7 studies met inclusion criteria consisting of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that examined various associations between psychiatric disorders and gut microbiota in youth. Six studies examined the effects of various treatment interventions such as probiotic supplementation on microbiota composition and behaviors. One study showed an increase in prosocial behavior in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and an increase in the Lachnospiraceae family following prebiotic supplementation. Another study suggested that prebiotic supplementation increased bifidobacterial populations for ASD and healthy controls. A study evaluating infant supplementation of prebiotics showed both a decreased likelihood of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or ASD and decreased gut Bifidobacterium. One study did not find significant differences in microbiome composition after micronutrient treatment. The main goal of this systematic review was to comprehensively examine and summarize the current evidence focused on the potential effect of the relationship between microbiota gut composition as well as the effects of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. This is a relatively new area of research and the number of included studies is limited. More studies are needed to determine whether gut dysbiosis leads to the development and/or contributes to the severity of mental disorders or whether gut dysbiosis is a result of other processes that accompany mental disorders. A better understanding of the specific bacteria contributions, gut-brain pathways, and role in pathophysiological mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent populations can possibly provide alternative tools for a clinical psychiatrist. Moreover, it may ultimately aid the clinician with intervention strategies, or detect populations at risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders."

The glucose homeostasis of participants with T2DM was improved by the high-fiber diet, and the serum metabolome, systemic inflammation and psychiatric comorbidities were also altered. The increased abundances of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Akkermansias</i> revealed that the proportions of beneficial gut microbes were enriched by the high-fiber diet, while the abundances of <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i> and other opportunistic pathogens were decreased. Therefore, the current study demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota alterations which were influenced by the high-fiber diet could improve the serum metabolism and emotional mood of patients with T2DM."

        "abstract": "Military veterans account for 8% of homeless individuals living in the United States. To highlight associations between history of homelessness and the gut microbiome, we compared the gut microbiome of veterans who reported having a previous experience of homelessness to those from individuals who reported never having experienced a period of homelessness. Moreover, we examined the impact of the cumulative exposure of prior and current homelessness to understand possible associations between these experiences and the gut microbiome. Microbiome samples underwent genomic sequencing and were analyzed based on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, demographic information, dietary data, and mental health history were collected. A lifetime history of homelessness was found to be associated with alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, and healthy eating index compared to those without such a history. In terms of differences in gut microbiota, beta diversity was significantly different between veterans who had experienced homelessness and veterans who had never been homeless (<i>P</i> = 0.047, weighted UniFrac), while alpha diversity was similar. The microbial community differences were, in part, driven by a lower relative abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i> in veterans who had experienced homelessness (mean; range [in percentages], 1.07; 0-33.9) compared to veterans who had never been homeless (2.02; 0-36.8) (<i>P</i> = 0.014, ancom-bc2). Additional research is required to facilitate understanding regarding the complex associations between homelessness, the gut microbiome, and mental and physical health conditions, with a focus on increasing understanding regarding the longitudinal impact of housing instability throughout the lifespan.IMPORTANCEAlthough there are known stressors related to homelessness as well as chronic health conditions experienced by those without stable housing, there has been limited work evaluating the associations between microbial community composition and homelessness. We analyzed, for the first time, bacterial gut microbiome associations among those with experiences of homelessness on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, we characterized the influences of diet, demographic characteristics, military service history, and mental health conditions on the microbiome of veterans with and without any lifetime history of homelessness. Future longitudinal research to evaluate the complex relationships between homelessness, the gut microbiome, and mental health outcomes is recommended. Ultimately, differences in the gut microbiome of individuals experiencing and not experiencing homelessness could assist in identification of treatment targets to improve health outcomes."

Studies have reported that food fermentation with probiotics can enrich the nutritional values of food and produce functional microorganisms that can alleviate depression and anxiety. Wheat germ is an inexpensive raw material that is rich in bioactive ingredients. For example, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is reported to have antidepressant effects. Several studies concluded that <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> is a GABA-producing bacteria and can alleviate depression. Herein, fermented wheat germs (FWGs) were used to treat stress-induced depression. FWG was prepared by fermenting wheat germs with <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was established in rats, and these rats were treated with FWG for four weeks to evaluate the effects of FWG in relieving depression. In addition, the study also analyzed the potential anti-depressive mechanism of FWG based on behavioral changes, physiological and biochemical index changes, and intestinal flora changes in depressed rats. The results demonstrated that FWG improved depression-like behaviors and increased neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus of CUMS model rats. In addition, FWG effectively altered the gut microbiota structure and remodeled the gut microbiota in CUMS rats, restored neurotransmitter levels in depressed rats through the brain-gut axis, and restored amino acid metabolic functions. In conclusion, we suggest that FWG has antidepressant effects, and its potential mechanism may act by restoring the disordered brain-gut axis."

Acetylated-, butylated-, and isobutylated-starch could attenuate the depression-like behaviors and excessive corticosterone production in chronically stressed mice. Butylated- starch significantly reduced the colonic permeability <i>via</i> increasing the tight junction proteins (including ZO-1, Claudin, and Occludin) gene expression and reduced the level of the inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6). The butylated starch's neurological and immunological benefits may be derived from the gut microbiome modifications, including normalizing the abundance of certain beneficial microbes (<i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Oscillibacter</i>) and metabolomic pathways (<i>Tryptophan synthesis</i> and <i>Inositol degradation</i>). The present findings further validate the brain-beneficial effect of butyrate and offer novel guidance for developing novel food or dietary supplements for improving mental health."

The human microbiome consists of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and phages. Recent advances in genomic sequencing have catalyzed a deeper understanding of complex microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Dysregulation of these interactions, or dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, has been implicated in a growing list of pathologies including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, Parkinson's disease, autism, and various gastrointestinal cancers. Gastric and esophageal cancer, for example, continue to remain as two of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, therefore there is an increased emphasis on investigating the role of dysbiosis on these cancers. In this review, we discuss the development and structure of the gut microbiome, its homeostatic and dysbiotic mechanisms, and the key microbes in esophageal and gastric carcinogenesis with a focus on bacterial biology. Further clarification of these pathways and discovery of diagnostic or therapeutic targets could have broad impacts on global subpopulations. It is important to understand the nature of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome and its potentional risk factors for dysbiosis in order to tailor its application to the individual patient and create an era of highly personalized, precision medicine."

As a major site of contact with the environment, questions have emerged surrounding the cause and effect of alterations to the gut microbiome by environmental contaminants associated with PD risk, such as pesticides, metals, and organic solvents. Recent data from our lab shows that ingestion of the industrial byproduct and environmental pollutant trichloroethylene (TCE) induces key Parkinsonian pathology within aged rats, including the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, neuroinflammation, and endolysosomal deficits. As TCE is the most common organic contaminant within drinking water, we postulated that ingestion of TCE associated with PD-related neurodegeneration may alter the gut microbiome to a similar extent as observed in persons with PD. To assess this, we collected fecal samples from adult rats treated with 200\u00a0mg/kg TCE over 6\u00a0weeks via oral gavage - the dose that produced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration - and analyzed the gut microbiome via whole genome shotgun sequencing. Our results showed changes in gut microorganisms reflective of the microbial signatures observed in individuals with idiopathic PD, such as decreased abundance of short-chain fatty acid producing Blautia and elevated lactic-acid producing Bifidobacteria, as well as genera who contain species previously reported as opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium. From these experimental data, we postulate that TCE exposure within contaminated drinking water could induce alterations of the gut microbiome that contributes to chronic disease risk, including idiopathic PD."

The gut microbiota has an important role in the host's metabolic and muscular health: however, its interplay with disease-related malnutrition is not well understood. We aimed to identify the association of malnutrition with the gut microbiota and predict clinical outcomes in hospitalized acutely ill older adults. We performed a secondary longitudinal analysis in 108 geriatric patients from a prospective cohort evaluated at admission and 72 h of hospitalization. We collected clinical, demographic, nutritional, and 16S rRNA gene-sequenced gut microbiota data. Microbiota diversity, overall composition, and differential abundance were calculated and compared between patients with and without malnutrition. Microbiota features associated with malnutrition were used to predict clinical outcomes. Patients with malnutrition (51%) had a different microbiota composition compared to those who were well-nourished during hospitalization (ANOSIM R = 0.079, P = 0.003). Patients with severe malnutrition showed poorer \u03b1-diversity at admission (Shannon P = 0.012, Simpson P = 0.018) and follow-up (Shannon P = 0.023, Chao1 P = 0.008). Differential abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Subdoligranulum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly lower and inversely associated with malnutrition, while Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and Fusobacterium were significantly increased and positively associated with malnutrition. Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and the overall composition were important predictors of critical care in patients with malnutrition during hospitalization. Older adults with malnutrition, especially in a severe stage, may be subject to substantial gut microbial disturbances during hospitalization. The gut microbiota profile of patients with malnutrition might help us to predict worse clinical outcomes."

Recently, a large body of research shows that the gut microbiome affects the brain and its conditions, through the gut-brain axis. The purpose of this mini-review is to provide a brief overview of the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis in three neurological disorders: epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and migraine. The authors chose these three disorders because of their burdensome and great effect on health care. We live on a microbial planet. Before humans, microorganisms existed for a hundred million years. Today, there are trillions of these microbes living in our bodies, it is called human microbiota. These organisms have a crucial role in our homeostasis and survival. Most of the human microbiota live in the gut. The number of gut microbiota is much more than the number of body cells. Gut microbiota has been regarded as a crucial regulator of the gut-brain axis. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is described as a major advancement in neuroscience because it influences the pathophysiology of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. From this, more studies of the microbiota-gut-brain axis are needed in the future, to provide a better understanding of brain disorders and so that better treatment and prognosis."

Plasma concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-18, GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 were measured by a multiplex immunoassay and relationships between microbiota, clinical characteristics, and cytokine levels were analyzed in the PD group. We further examined the cytokine changes associated with the altered gut microbiota seen in patients with PD in another independent cohort of 120 PD patients and 120 controls. Microbiota from patients with PD was altered relative to controls and dominated by Verrucomicrobia, Mucispirillum, Porphyromonas, Lactobacillus, and Parabacteroides. In contrast, Prevotella was more abundant in controls. The abundances of Bacteroides were more increased in patients with non-tremor PD subtype than patients with tremor subtype. Bacteroides abundance was correlated with motor symptom severity defined by UPDRS part III motor scores (rho\u2009=\u20090.637 [95% confidence interval 0.474 to 0.758], P\u2009<\u20090.01).

In the present study, we discovered a <i>L. fermentum</i> strain, GR1009, isolated from the same source of PS150, and found that GR1009 is phenotypically distinct but genetically similar to PS150. Compared with PS150, GR1009 have no significant hypnotic effects in the pentobarbital-induced sleep test in mice. In addition, we found that heat-killed PS150 exhibited hypnotic effects and altered the gut microbiota in a manner similar to live bacteria, suggesting that a heat-stable effector, such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), could be responsible for these effects. Our comparative genomics analysis also revealed distinct genetic characteristics in EPS biosynthesis between GR1009 and PS150. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy imaging showed a sheet-like EPS structure in PS150, while GR1009 displayed no apparent EPS structure. Using the phenol-sulfate assay, we found that the sugar content value of the crude extract containing EPS (C-EPS) from PS150 was approximately five times higher than that of GR1009, indicating that GR1009 has a lower EPS production activity than PS150. Through the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, we confirmed the hypnotic effects of the C-EPS isolated from PS150, as evidenced by a significant reduction in sleep latency and recovery time following oral administration in mice. In summary, we utilized a comparative approach to delineate differences between PS150 and GR1009 and proposed that EPS may serve as a key factor that mediates the observed hypnotic effect."

However, there is no specific evidence to support treatment of anxiety by regulating intestinal microbiota. To find evidence supporting improvement of anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota. This systematic review of randomised controlled trials was searched based on the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, OVID, Web of Knowledge, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP databases and SinoMed. The retrieval time dated back to 25 July 2018. Then we screened research literatures based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality evaluation for each included study was done using the Cochrane risk of bias and the Jadad scale. A total of 3334 articles were retrieved and 21 studies were included which contained 1503 subjects. In the 21 studies, 15 chose probiotics as interventions to regulate intestinal microbiota and six chose non-probiotic ways such as adjusting daily diets. Probiotic supplements in seven studies contained only one kind of probiotic, two studies used a product that contained two kinds of probiotics and the supplements used in the other five studies included at least three kinds of probiotics. In the studies that used treatment as usual plus interventions regulating intestinal flora (IRIF) as interventions (five studies), only non-probiotic ways were effective (two studies), which means 40% of studies were effective; in the studies that used IRIF alone (16 studies, 11 studies used probiotic ways and 5 studies used non-probiotic ways), 56% of studies could improve anxiety symptoms, and 80% of studies that conducted the non-probiotic interventions were effective, while 45% of studies that used probiotic supplementations had positive effects on anxiety symptoms. Overall, 11 studies showed a positive effect on anxiety symptoms by regulating intestinal microbiota, which indicated 52% of the 21 studies were effective, and there were five studies that used probiotic supplements as interventions and six used non-probiotic interventions. In addition, it should be noted that six of seven studies showed that regulation of intestinal microbiota could treat anxiety symptoms, the rate of efficacy was 86%. We find that more than half of the studies included showed it was positive to treat anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota. There are two kinds of interventions (probiotic and non-probiotic interventions) to regulate intestinal microbiota, and it should be highlighted that the non-probiotic interventions were more effective than the probiotic interventions.

        "abstract": "Depression is one of the complications in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that leads to considerable mental health. Accumulating evidence suggests that human gut microbiomes are associated with the progression of PCOS and depression. However, whether microbiota influences depression development in PCOS patients is still uncharacterized. In this study, we employed metagenomic sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile the composition of the fecal microbiota and gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in depressed women with PCOS (PCOS-DP, n\u2009=\u200927) in comparison to mentally healthy women with PCOS (PCOS, n\u2009=\u200918) and compared with healthy control (HC, n\u2009=\u200927) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD, n\u2009=\u200929). Gut microbiota assessment revealed distinct patterns in the relative abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to HC, MDD, and PCOS groups. Several gut microbes exhibited uniquely and significantly higher abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to PCOS patients, inducing EC Ruminococcus torques, Coprococcus comes, Megasphaera elsdenii, Acidaminococcus intestini, and Barnesiella viscericola. Bacteroides eggerthii was a potential gut microbial biomarker for the PCOS-DP. RNA-seq profiling identified that 35 and 37 genes were significantly elevated and downregulated in the PCOS-DP, respectively. The enhanced differential expressed genes (DEGs) in the PCOS-DP were enriched in pathways involved in signal transduction and endocrine and metabolic diseases, whereas several lipid metabolism pathways were downregulated. Intriguingly, genes correlated with the gut microbiota were found to be significantly enriched in pathways of neurodegenerative diseases and the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota may have a systemic impact on the expression of neurodegenerative diseases and immune genes. Gut microbe-related DEGs of CREB3L3 and CCDC173 were possible molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets of women with PCOS-DP. Our multi-omics data indicate shifts in the gut microbiome and host gene regulation in PCOS patients with depression, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance."

        "abstract": "Several bacterial species can generate hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Study evidence favors the view that the microbiome of the colon harbors increased amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S producing bacteria in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>S can easily penetrate cell membranes and enter the cell interior. In the cells, excessive amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S can potentially release cytochrome c protein from the mitochondria, increase the iron content of the cytosolic iron pool, and increase the amount of reactive oxygen species. These events can lead to the formation of alpha-synuclein oligomers and fibrils in cells containing the alpha-synuclein protein. In addition, bacterially produced H<sub>2</sub>S can interfere with the body urate metabolism and affect the blood erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Gut bacteria responsible for increased H<sub>2</sub>S production, especially the mucus-associated species of the bacterial genera belonging to the Desulfovibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families, are likely play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Special attention should be devoted to changes not only in the colonic but also in the duodenal microbiome composition with regard to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Influenza infections may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease by causing the overgrowth of H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria both in the colon and duodenum."

        "abstract": "<i>Background</i>: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition typically characterized by deficits in social and communicative behaviors as well as repetitive patterns of behaviors. Despite its prevalence (affecting 0.1% to 1.8% of the global population), the pathogenesis of ASD remains incompletely understood. Patients with ASD are reported to have more frequent gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. There is some anecdotal evidence that probiotics are able to alleviate GI symptoms as well as improve behavioral issues in children with ASD. However, systematic reviews of the effect of prebiotics/probiotics on ASD and its associated symptoms are lacking. <i>Methods</i>: Using the keywords (prebiotics OR probiotics OR microbiota OR gut) AND (autism OR social OR ASD), a systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar databases. The inclusion criteria were original clinical trials, published in English between the period 1st January 1988 and 1st February 2019. <i>Results</i>: A total of eight clinical trials were systematically reviewed. Two clinical trials examined the use of prebiotic and/or diet exclusion while six involved the use of probiotic supplementation in children with ASD. Most of these were prospective, open-label studies. Prebiotics only improved certain GI symptoms; however, when combined with an exclusion diet (gluten and casein free) showed a significant reduction in anti-sociability scores. As for probiotics, there is limited evidence to support the role of probiotics in alleviating the GI or behavioral symptoms in children with ASD. The two available double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials found no significant difference in GI symptoms and behavior. <i>Conclusion</i>: Despite promising preclinical findings, prebiotics and probiotics have demonstrated an overall limited efficacy in the management of GI or behavioral symptoms in children with ASD. In addition, there was no standardized probiotics regimen, with multiple different strains and concentrations of probiotics, and variable duration of treatments."

Growing evidence has shown the alterations in the gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites in ASD. However, how the altered microbiota might affect the associations between unbalanced diets and GI symptoms in ASD remains unknown. We analyzed microbiome and metabolomics data in 90 ASD and 90 typically developing (TD) children based on 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolomics, together with dietary intake and GI symptoms assessment. We found that there existed 11 altered gut microbiota (FDR-corrected P-value <0.05) and 397 altered metabolites (P-value <0.05) in children with ASD compared with TD children. Among the 11 altered microbiota, the <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group</i> were positively correlated with constipation (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). The Eggerthellaceae was positively correlated with total GI symptoms (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). More importantly, three increased microbiota including <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and Eggerthellaceae positively modulated the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with constipation and total GI symptoms, and the decreased <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i> negatively modulated their associations in ASD children (P-value <0.05). Together, the altered microbiota strengthens the relationship between unbalanced dietary intake and GI symptoms. Among the altered metabolites, ten metabolites derived from microbiota (<i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, Eggerthellaceae, and <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i>) were screened out, enriched in eight metabolic pathways, and were identified to correlate with constipation and total GI symptoms in ASD children (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). These metabolomics findings further support the modulating role of gut microbiota on the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with GI symptoms. Collectively, our research provides insights into the relationship between diet, the gut microbiota, and GI symptoms in children with ASD."

However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut microbiota composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the microbiota community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers for MDD. The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890. The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut microbiota and the related Trp pathway in MDD. Alterations of the gut microbiota may have the potential as biomarkers for distinguishing MDD patients form HCs."

The NVP-1704 group had a more significant reduction in depressive symptoms at four and eight weeks of treatment, and anxiety symptoms at four weeks compared to the placebo group. Those receiving NVP-1704 also experienced an improvement in sleep quality. NVP-1704 treatment led to a decrease in serum interleukin-6 levels. Furthermore, NVP-1704 increased <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillacea</i>, whereas it decreased <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in the gut microbiota composition.

Here, CCRA model was successfully induced by subcutaneous inoculation of CT-26 and i.p. oxaliplatin, rhEPO + DBD high dosage + Fe (EDF) and rhEPO + DBD high dosage (ED) groups had the best blood enrichment effect. Attractively, EDF group also showed antitumor activity. The sequencing results of gut microbiota showed that compared to P group, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and opportunistic pathogen (Odoribacter) in ED and EDF groups were decreased. Interestingly, EDF also decreased the relative abundances of cancer-related bacteria (Helicobacter, Lactococcus, Alloprevotella) and imbalance-inducing bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Parabacteroides) and increased the relative abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria (Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014), however, ED showed the opposite effects to EDF, this might be the reason of the smaller tumor volume in EDF group. Our findings proposed the best treatment combination of DBD, rhEPO and Fe in CCRA and provided theoretical basis and literature reference for CCRA-induced intestinal flora disorder and the regulatory mechanism of EDF."

Gut microbial changes by fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotics treatment reportedly modulates depressive symptoms. However, it remains unclear how gut dysbiosis contributes to mental dysfunction, and how correction of the gut microbiota alleviates neuropsychiatric disorders. Our previous study showed that chronic consumption of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> ATG-F4 (F4) induced neurometabolic alterations in healthy mice. Here, we investigated whether F4 exerted therapeutic effects on depressive-like behavior by influencing the central nervous system. Using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce anhedonia, a key symptom of MDD, we found that chronic F4 consumption alleviated CUS-induced anhedonic behaviors, accompanied by biochemical changes in the gut, serum, and brain. Serum and brain metabolite concentrations involved in tryptophan metabolism were regulated by CUS and F4. F4 consumption reduced the elevated levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain observed in the CUS group. Additionally, the increased expression of <i>Htr1a</i>, a subtype of the 5-HT receptor, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of stressed mice was restored to levels observed in stress-na\u00efve mice following F4 supplementation. We further demonstrated the role of <i>Htr1a</i> using AAV-shRNA to downregulate <i>Htr1a</i> in the mPFC of CUS mice, effectively reversing CUS-induced anhedonic behavior. Together, our findings suggest F4 as a potential therapeutic approach for relieving some depressive symptoms and highlight the involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in mitigating CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors through the action of this bacterium."

Recently, evidence has been provided for both, with Parkinson's disease onset presenting as either a \"body-first\" or \"brain-first\" progression. Most research indicates those with Parkinson's disease have an altered gut microbiome compared to controls. However, some studies do not report gut microbiome differences, potentially due to the brain or body-first progression type. Based on the etiology of each proposed progression, individuals with the body-first progression may exhibit altered gut microbiomes, i.e., where short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria are reduced, while the brain-first progression may not. Future microbiome research should consider this hypothesis and investigate whether gut microbiome differences exist between each type of progression. This may further elucidate the impact of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and show how it may not be homogenous across individuals with Parkinson's disease."

Modulating the gut microbiota is a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of CRC treatment and reduce its adverse effects. The causal relationship between specific microorganisms' presence and CRC development has been widely validated. However, few studies have investigated this relationship using bibliometric methods. Therefore, this study analyzed the research hotspots and trends in human gut microbiology and CRC over the last two decades from a bibliometric perspective. The study aims to provide novel insights into basic and clinical research in this field. The articles and reviews on gut microbiota in CRC were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) on November 2, 2022. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to conduct the bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis. A total of 2,707 publications were obtained, with a rapid increase in the number of publications since 2015. The United States and China are the main contributors in this field and have established a network of partnerships in several countries. 414 academic journals have published articles on this topic. The author with the highest number of publications is Jun Yu from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to \"intestinal flora\" and \"colorectal cancer,\" high frequency terms in the keyword co-occurrence network analysis included inflammatory bowel disease, <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, inflammation, long-chain fatty acids, ulcerative colitis, bile acids, and resistant starch. Analysis of keyword trends using burst testing revealed that biomarkers, abnormal crypt foci, bifidobacteria, \u03b2-glucuronidase, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and DNA methylation are at the forefront of research in this area.

The development of sophisticated bioinformatics and data science tools for the analysis of large amounts of data followed. Since then, the analyzed gut microbiome data, where microbiome is defined as a network of microorganisms inhabiting the human intestinal system, has been associated with several conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome - IBS, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and lately in the study of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well. This paper aims to provide an understanding of differences between microbial data of individuals who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and those who were not by exploiting data science techniques on publicly available data. This study examines the relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune central nervous system disease, and gut microbial community composition, using the samples acquired by 16s rRNA sequencing technique. We have used three different sets of MS samples sequenced during three independent studies (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 2016), (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015), (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) and this approach strengthens our results. Analyzed sequences were from healthy control and MS groups of sequences. The extracted set of statistically significant bacteria from the (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 2016) dataset samples and their statistically significant predictive functions were used to develop a Random Forest classifier. In total, 8 models based on two criteria: bacteria abundance (at six taxonomic levels) and predictive functions (at two levels), were constructed and evaluated. These include using taxa abundances at different taxonomy levels as well as predictive function analysis at different hierarchical levels of KEGG pathways. The highest accuracy of the classification model was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (76.82%) and the third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (70.95%). The second dataset's 18 MS samples (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015) and 18 self-reported healthy samples from the (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) dataset were used to validate the developed classification model. The significance of this step is to show that the model is not overtrained for a specific dataset but can also be used on other independent datasets. Again, the highest classification model accuracy for both validating datasets combined was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (70.98%) and third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (67.24%). The accuracy of the independent set remained very relevant. Our results demonstrate that the developed classification model provides a good tool that can be used to suggest the presence or absence of MS condition by collecting and analyzing gut microbiome samples. The accuracy of the model can be further increased by using sequencing methods that allow higher taxa resolution (i.e. shotgun metagenomic sequencing)."

Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder, both in the sense that many different factors may play a role in its manifestation and that multiple systems throughout the body can be affected. Polycystic ovarian syndrome has been linked to an increased prevalence of various psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. Despite the socioeconomic effect that these disorders may have on patients with PCOS and society as a whole, this association is largely lacking in research. There are currently several theories regarding the link between PCOS and mental health. Some suggest that the overactive hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes in PCOS patients may alter the hormonal profile and contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. Other studies speculate that abnormal levels of neurotransmitters and neuronal signaling may play a role. Recently, more research has begun to focus on the gut-brain axis, addressing the nutritional needs of PCOS patients. Studies show that dietary factors such as probiotics and micronutrient supplementation may significantly improve psychiatric symptoms in PCOS patients while helping regulate neurotransmitter levels in the body. In this review, we examine different theories regarding the association between PCOS and psychiatric disorders and point out different areas of research that are needed to broaden our understanding of this association."

We systematically searched the databases CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and LILACS. Primary outcome was to compare the gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression with healthy controls. We identified 17 studies, covering 744 patients and 620 healthy controls. The most consistent microbiota changes were a tendency towards higher abundance of Actinobacteria and lower abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level, lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae at family level and lower abundance of Faecalibacterium at genus level for the mental disorders overall. However, we found that all studies had risk of bias and that the included studies displayed great variability in methods of storage, analysis of the fecal samples, reporting of results and statistics used. Due to the many limitations of the included studies the findings should be interpreted with caution.

        "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> To comprehensively review the scientific knowledge on the gut-brain axis. <b>Methods:</b> Various publications on the gut-brain axis, until 31 July 2017, were screened using the Medline, Google, and Cochrane Library databases. The search was performed using the following keywords: \"gut-brain axis\", \"gut-microbiota-brain axis\", \"nutrition microbiome/microbiota\", \"enteric nervous system\", \"enteric glial cells/network\", \"gut-brain pathways\", \"microbiome immune system\", \"microbiome neuroendocrine system\" and \"intestinal/gut/enteric neuropeptides\". Relevant articles were selected and reviewed. <b>Results:</b> Tremendous progress has been made in exploring the interactions between nutrients, the microbiome, and the intestinal, epithelium-enteric nervous, endocrine and immune systems and the brain. The basis of the gut-brain axis comprises of an array of multichannel sensing and trafficking pathways that are suggested to convey the enteric signals to the brain. These are mediated by neuroanatomy (represented by the vagal and spinal afferent neurons), the neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (represented by the gut hormones), immune routes (represented by multiple cytokines), microbially-derived neurotransmitters, and finally the gate keepers of the intestinal and brain barriers. Their mutual and harmonious but intricate interaction is essential for human life and brain performance. However, a failure in the interaction leads to a number of inflammatory-, autoimmune-, neurodegenerative-, metabolic-, mood-, behavioral-, cognitive-, autism-spectrum-, stress- and pain-related disorders. The limited availability of information on the mechanisms, pathways and cause-and-effect relationships hinders us from translating and implementing the knowledge from the bench to the clinic. <b>Implications:</b> Further understanding of this intricate field might potentially shed light on novel preventive and therapeutic strategies to combat these disorders. Nutritional approaches, microbiome manipulations, enteric and brain barrier reinforcement and sensing and trafficking modulation might improve physical and mental health outcomes."

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, \u03b1-synuclein pathology, and neurodegeneration. Most cases of PD are non-hereditary, suggesting a strong role for environmental factors, and it has been speculated that disease may originate in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before affecting the brain. The gut microbiome is altered in PD and may impact motor and GI symptoms as indicated by animal studies, although mechanisms of gut-brain interactions remain incompletely defined. Intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, with fecal levels of these molecules differing between PD and healthy controls and in mouse models. Among other effects, dietary microbial metabolites can modulate activation of microglia, brain-resident immune cells implicated in PD. We therefore investigated whether a fiber-rich diet influences microglial function in \u03b1-synuclein overexpressing (ASO) mice, a preclinical model with PD-like symptoms and pathology. Feeding a prebiotic high-fiber diet attenuates motor deficits and reduces \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of mice. Concomitantly, the gut microbiome of ASO mice adopts a profile correlated with health upon prebiotic treatment, which also reduces microglial activation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of microglia from the substantia nigra and striatum uncovers increased pro-inflammatory signaling and reduced homeostatic responses in ASO mice compared to wild-type counterparts on standard diets. However, prebiotic feeding reverses pathogenic microglial states in ASO mice and promotes expansion of protective disease-associated macrophage (DAM) subsets of microglia. Notably, depletion of microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor eliminates the beneficial effects of prebiotics by restoring motor deficits to ASO mice despite feeding a prebiotic diet. These studies uncover a novel microglia-dependent interaction between diet and motor symptoms in mice, findings that may have implications for neuroinflammation and PD."

This study also evaluated the relationship between gut microbiota changes and increased inflammatory cytokines in insomnia patients. Outpatients with acute and chronic insomnia (aged 26-55 years; n=20 and 38, respectively) and age/gender-matched healthy controls (n=38) were recruited from a southern China region. Participants' gut microbiome, plasma cytokines, and self-reported sleep quality and psychopathological symptoms were measured. The gut microbiomes of insomnia patients compared with healthy controls were characterized by lower microbial richness and diversity, depletion of anaerobes, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and an expansion of potential pathobionts. <i>Lachnospira</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing acute insomnia patients from healthy controls, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Blautia</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing chronic insomnia patients from healthy controls. Acute/chronic insomnia-related signature bacteria also showed correlations with these patients' self-reported sleep quality and plasma IL-1\u03b2. These \ufb01ndings suggest that insomnia symptomology, gut microbiota, and inflammation may be interrelated in complex ways.

In this study, we conducted MR analysis between large-scale GWAS data of GMs and insomnia to uncover potential associations. Ten GM taxa were detected to have causal associations with insomnia. Among them, class <i>Negativicutes</i>, genus <i>Clostridiuminnocuumgroup</i>, genus <i>Dorea</i>, genus <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>, genus <i>Prevotella7</i>, and order <i>Selenomonadalesare</i> were linked to a higher risk of insomnia. In reverse MR analysis, we discovered a causal link between insomnia and six other GM taxa. It suggested that the relationship between insomnia and intestinal flora was convoluted. Our findings may offer beneficial biomarkers for disease development and prospective candidate treatment targets for insomnia."

Abnormalities in this microbiota-gut-brain axis have emerged as a key component in the pathophysiology of depression, leading to more research attempting to understand the neuroactive potential of the products of gut microbial metabolism. This review explores the potential for the gut microbiota to contribute to depression and focuses on the role that microbially-derived molecules - neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids, indoles, bile acids, choline metabolites, lactate and vitamins - play in the context of emotional behavior. The future of gut-brain axis research lies is moving away from association, towards the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the gut bacteria and depressive behavior. We propose that direct and indirect mechanisms exist through which gut microbial metabolites affect depressive behavior: these include (i) direct stimulation of central receptors, (ii) peripheral stimulation of neural, endocrine, and immune mediators, and (iii) epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to expand our understanding of the etiology of depression, and to develop new strategies to harness the beneficial psychotropic effects of these molecules. Overall, the review highlights the potential for dietary interventions to represent such novel therapeutic strategies for major depressive disorder."

        "year": "2014",
        "abstract": "The cell danger response (CDR) is the evolutionarily conserved metabolic response that protects cells and hosts from harm. It is triggered by encounters with chemical, physical, or biological threats that exceed the cellular capacity for homeostasis. The resulting metabolic mismatch between available resources and functional capacity produces a cascade of changes in cellular electron flow, oxygen consumption, redox, membrane fluidity, lipid dynamics, bioenergetics, carbon and sulfur resource allocation, protein folding and aggregation, vitamin availability, metal homeostasis, indole, pterin, 1-carbon and polyamine metabolism, and polymer formation. The first wave of danger signals consists of the release of metabolic intermediates like ATP and ADP, Krebs cycle intermediates, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and is sustained by purinergic signaling. After the danger has been eliminated or neutralized, a choreographed sequence of anti-inflammatory and regenerative pathways is activated to reverse the CDR and to heal. When the CDR persists abnormally, whole body metabolism and the gut microbiome are disturbed, the collective performance of multiple organ systems is impaired, behavior is changed, and chronic disease results. Metabolic memory of past stress encounters is stored in the form of altered mitochondrial and cellular macromolecule content, resulting in an increase in functional reserve capacity through a process known as mitocellular hormesis. The systemic form of the CDR, and its magnified form, the purinergic life-threat response (PLTR), are under direct control by ancient pathways in the brain that are ultimately coordinated by centers in the brainstem. Chemosensory integration of whole body metabolism occurs in the brainstem and is a prerequisite for normal brain, motor, vestibular, sensory, social, and speech development. An understanding of the CDR permits us to reframe old concepts of pathogenesis for a broad array of chronic, developmental, autoimmune, and degenerative disorders. These disorders include autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma, atopy, gluten and many other food and chemical sensitivity syndromes, emphysema, Tourette's syndrome, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), traumatic brain injury (TBI), epilepsy, suicidal ideation, organ transplant biology, diabetes, kidney, liver, and heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, and autoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis."

In this study, we explored the association between gut microbiota and cognitive function in MDD and its possible mechanisms. We enrolled 57 patients with MDD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) and used 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis to determine gut microbial composition. The richness and diversity of gut microbiota in patients with MDD were the same as those in HCs, but there were differences in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Blautia. Compared with HCs, two strains (bin_32 and bin_55) were significantly increased, and one strain (bin_31) was significantly decreased in patients with MDD based on the strain-level meta-analysis. Time to complete the Stroop-C had significant negative correlations with bin_31 and bin_32. Bin_55 had significant negative correlations with time to complete the Stroop-C, time to complete the Stroop-CW, and repeated animal words in 60\u00a0s but significant positive correlations with correct answers in 120\u00a0s on the Stroop-CW. This study only tested the cognitive function of MDD in a small sample, which may have caused some bias. Based on our strain-level analysis, we found that gut microbiota may be associated with the pathogenesis of MDD and may have potential effects on cognitive function."

Meditation, as an inner mental exercise, can positively impact the regulation of an individual's physical and mental health. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated faecal microbiota following long-term (several years) deep meditation. Therefore, we propose that long-term meditation may regulate gut microbiota homeostasis and, in turn, affect physical and mental health. To investigate the effects of long-term deep meditation on the gut microbiome structure. To examine the intestinal flora, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on faecal samples of 56 Tibetan Buddhist monks and neighbouring residents. Based on the sequencing data, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed to identify differential intestinal microbial communities between the two groups. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis was used to predict the function of faecal microbiota. In addition, we evaluated biochemical indices in the plasma. The \u03b1-diversity indices of the meditation and control groups differed significantly. At the genus level, <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were significantly enriched in the meditation group. According to the LEfSe analysis, two beneficial bacterial genera (<i>Megamonas</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>) were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Functional predictive analysis further showed that several pathways-including glycan biosynthesis, metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis-were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Moreover, plasma levels of clinical risk factors were significantly decreased in the meditation group, including total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Long-term traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation may positively impact physical and mental health. We confirmed that the gut microbiota composition differed between the monks and control subjects. The microbiota enriched in monks was associated with a reduced risk of anxiety, depression and cardiovascular disease and could enhance immune function. Overall, these results suggest that meditation plays a positive role in psychosomatic conditions and well-being."

This article describes new developments in brain-gut interactions as an introduction to a special issue of Psychosomatic Medicine, based on a joint symposium of the American Psychosomatic Society and the American Gastroenterological Association. Literature review articles indicate that several psychiatric disorders are associated with altered gut microbiota, whereas evidence linking functional gastrointestinal disorders and dysbiosis has not been firmly established. The association between dysbiosis with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus is still inconclusive, but evidence suggests that bariatric surgery may favorably alter the gut microbial community structure. Consistent with the literature linking psychiatric disorders with dysbiosis is that life adversity during childhood and certain temperaments that develop early in life are associated with altered gut microbiota, particularly the Prevotella species. Some studies reported in this issue support the hypothesis that brain-gut interactions are adversely influenced by reduced functional activation of the hippocampus and autonomic nervous system dysregulation. The evidence for the effects of probiotics in the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis is relatively well established, but effects on mental health and psychophysiological stress reactivity are either inconclusive or still in progress. To conceptualize brain-gut interactions, a holistic, systems-based perspective on health and disease is needed, integrating gut microbial with environmental ecology. More translational research is needed to examine the mental and physical health effects of prebiotics and probiotics, in well-phenotyped human populations with sufficiently large sample sizes."

The aim of current study was to evaluate the potential of a particular set of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) as potential non-invasive plasma markers of ongoing neurodegeneration from Parkinson's disease in human subjects. A panel of seven NAPEs were quantified by LC-MS/MS in the plasma of 587 individuals (healthy controls, n\u2009=\u2009319; Parkinson's disease, n\u2009=\u2009268); Random Forest classification and statistical modeling was applied to compare Parkinson's disease versus controls. All p-values obtained in different tests were corrected for multiplicity by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). The results indicate that this panel of NAPEs is able to distinguish female PD patients from the corresponding healthy controls. Further to this, the observed downregulation of these NAPEs is in line with the results in plasma of a mouse model of Parkinson's (6-OHDA). In the current study we have shown the downregulation of NAPEs in plasma of PD patients and we thus speculate that these lipids might serve as candidate biomarkers for PD.

We retrieved publications concerning the interplay between the gut microbiota and bipolar disorder from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). The analysis was executed using WoSCC's literature analysis tool and VOSviewer 1.6.16. In total, we identified 177 publications originating from 362 institutions across 39 countries/regions, and these articles were disseminated in 104 different journals. The most productive institutions, authors, countries/regions, and journals were Zhejiang University contributing 18 publications, Shaohua Hu authoring 12 publications, China with 53 publications, and <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i> with 11 publications.

Well-controlled studies of the mediating and moderating effects of baseline and treatment-emergent changes in microbiota on therapeutic and adverse responses to antidepressants are needed to better establish a potential role of PMx in personalizing antidepressant treatment selection and response prediction."

Change in host microbiota is related to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases. This systematic review aims to gather existing data on the occidental hemisphere, compare it, and search for any significant association between Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota dysbiosis. (2) Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols were used for this systematic review. PubMed was used as the database search engine. Of the 166 studies found, only 10 were used, as they met our inclusion criteria: case-control studies, studies that assessed the correlation of PD and gut microbiome, studies that took place in occidental regions, and studies that were performed on humans and were written in English. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used as the assessment tool for overall risk of bias in this systematic review. (3) Results: The studies analyzed were divided into three geographic areas: Region 1: United States of America and Canada; Region 2: Germany, Ireland, and Finland; and Region 3: Italy; based on geographical similarities among these populations. The following statistically significant results were described in PD patients, compared with non-PD controls. In the first region, a significant increase in the following bacteria was seen: 1. Phylum: Actinobacteriota and its Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i>; 2. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 3. Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Hungatella</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Oscillospira</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> of Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Phylum: Bacteroidetes and its Genus: <i>Bacteroides</i>; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria. A significant decrease was described in the Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>, which belong to the Phylum: Firmicutes. In the second region, a raised number of: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota, its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>, and its Species: <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>; 2. Family: <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> of the Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota; 3. Genus: <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Family: <i>Barnesiellaceae</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes; 6. Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 7. Species: <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i> of the Phylum: Thermodesulfobacteriota, was identified. Only one Genus: <i>Prevotella</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes was decreased. In the third and last region, an augmented number of these bacteria were found: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 2. Family: <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 3. Phylum: Firmicutes and its Family: <i>Christensenellaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>; 4. Family: <i>Enterococcaceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Genus: <i>Lactococcus</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria, its Family: <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and the Genus: <i>Citrobacter</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>; 7. Genus: <i>ParaBacteroides</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes. In contrast, a significant decrease in 1. Phylum: Firmicutes, its Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and its Genus: <i>Roseburia</i> and 2. Genus: <i>Ruminococcus</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes, was described. (4) Conclusion: A significant gut dysbiosis, involving multiple bacterial taxa, was found in PD patients compared to healthy people in the occidental regions. However, more studies are needed to find the precise pathophysiologic involvement of other groups of pathogens, such as fungi and parasites, in the development and progression of PD."

Although the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women is about twice that of men, very few studies have examined whether physical exercise could affect mental health differently according to sex. This study examined, in singly-housed mice, the sex-specific effects of voluntary exercise on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors as well as on different markers along the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis. Male and female C57BL/6N mice had voluntary access to running wheels in their home-cages for 24 days or were left undisturbed in identical home-cages without running wheels. Behaviors were then examined in the open field, splash, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension tests. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation-related genes, and tight junction proteins was determined in the jejunum and the hippocampus, while microbiota composition and predicted function were verified in cecum contents. Voluntary exercise reduced anxiety-like behaviors and altered grooming patterns in males exclusively. Although the exercise intervention resulted in changes to brain inflammatory activity and to cecal microbiota composition and inferred function in both sexes, reductions in the jejunal expression of pro-inflammatory markers were observed in females only. These findings support the view that voluntary exercise, even when performed during a short period, is beneficial for mental and intestinal health and that its sex-specific effects on behavior could be, at least in part, related to some components of the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis."

The present study is aimed at revealing the mechanism of Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharide (PHP) in decreasing blood lipids by acting through gut-liver axis in Mesocricetus auratus fed a high-fat diet. PHP significantly prevented increases in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and alleviated damage to liver cells induced by a high-fat diet M. auratus, in a dose-dependent manner. PHP promotes proliferation of Muribaculaceae and Faecalibaculum, thereby enhancing the production of butyric acid both in the colon and liver, particularly high-dose PHP (HPHP). Low-dose PHP (LPHP) promotes the expression of phosphatidylcholine metabolites and fatty acid transport genes, and inhibits the expression of genes involved in fat degradation (Abhd5), adipogenesis (Me1), fatty acid synthesis (Fasn and Pnpla3), and fatty acid chain elongation (Elovl6) in the liver. However, HPHP inhibits the expression of triglyceride metabolites and promotes the expression of fatty acid transporter (CD36), fatty acid oxidation (Acacb), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg)\u00a0genes in the liver. PHP regulates lipid metabolism through the gut microbiota, and the gut-liver axis plays an important role in its hypolipidemic effects."

By exploring the intricate relationship between the gut and the brain, with the goal of offering fresh perspectives and valuable insights into the potential contribution of intestinal microbial and metabolites dysbiosis to the etiology of schizophrenia. In this study, we used a 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequence-based approach and an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach to measure the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites from 44 healthy controls, 41 acute patients, and 39 remission patients, to evaluate whether microbial dysbiosis and microbial metabolite biomarkers were linked with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms. Here, we identified 20 dominant disturbances in the gut microbial composition of patients compared with healthy controls, with 3 orders, 4 families, 9 genera, and 4 species. Several unique bacterial taxa associated with schizophrenia severity. Compared with healthy controls, 145 unusual microflora metabolites were detected in the acute and remission groups, which were mainly involved in environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems, and human diseases in the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway. The Sankey diagram showed that 4 abnormal intestinal and 4 anomalous intestinal microbial metabolites were associated with psychiatric clinical symptoms. These findings suggest a possible interactive influence of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."

Objective and methods By pooling two independent study samples of patients with AD (n\u00a0=\u00a0176), their unaffected first-degree relatives (n\u00a0=\u00a070) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0101) we aimed to replicate and extend our prior findings of differential Flavonifractor prevalence and Christensenellaceae abundance when comparing patients with AD and healthy controls. The gut microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results The pattern of higher prevalence of Flavonifractor and lower Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) abundance of Christensenellaceae was associated with AD. In generalized linear models the CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae was lower in patients with AD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024), and in smokers (p\u00a0=\u00a01.9*10<sup>-4</sup>), and inversely associated with increasing waist circumference (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031). The prevalence of Flavonifractor was higher in patients with AD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and in smokers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). No impact of psychotropic medication was found. The CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), but not the prevalence of Flavonifractor (p\u00a0=\u00a00.20) could distinguish non-smoking patients with AD from non-smoking healthy controls, whereas no such associations were found in smokers. Unaffected relatives neither differed from patients with AD nor from healthy controls. Conclusion Compared with findings in healthy controls, AD was associated with a significantly lower CLR abundance of the health-linked Christensenellaceae and a significantly higher prevalence of Flavonifractor; findings that are associated with enhanced oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation. If our observations are validated in future independent studies, they support the notion that parts of aberrant gut microbiota are shared by AD and states of dysmetabolism."

Further consideration of papers which incorporate functional analyses (e.g., metabolomics) is required to integrate this body of literature. Research investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in affective disorders has been met with great enthusiasm, offering promising direction for novel therapeutics in conditions such as depression.

        "abstract": "Various studies have highlighted the important associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gut microbiota and related metabolites. Nevertheless, the establishment of causal relationships between these associations remains to be determined. Multiple mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to genetically predict the causative impact of 196 gut microbiota and 83 metabolites on OSA. Two-sample MR was used to assess the potential association, and causality was evaluated using inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median (WM) methods. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was employed to ascertain the causal independence between gut microbiota and the metabolites linked to OSA. Additionally, Cochran's Q test, the MR Egger intercept test and the MR Steiger test were used for the sensitivity analyses. The analysis of the 196 gut microbiota revealed that <i>genus</i>_<i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (<i>UCG009</i>) (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.010) and <i>genus</i>_<i>Subdoligranulum</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.041) were associated with an increased risk of OSA onset. Conversely, <i>Family</i>_<i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.030), <i>genus</i>_<i>Coprococcus2</i> (P<sub>WM</sub> = 0.025), <i>genus</i>_<i>Eggerthella</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.011), and <i>genus</i>_<i>Eubacterium</i> (<i>xylanophilum</i>_<i>group</i>) (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.001) were negatively related to the risk of OSA. Among the 83 metabolites evaluated, 3-dehydrocarnitine, epiandrosterone sulfate, and leucine were determined to be potential independent risk factors associated with OSA. Moreover, the reverse MR analysis demonstrated a suggestive association between OSA exposure and six microbiota taxa. This study offers compelling evidence regarding the potential beneficial or detrimental causative impact of the gut microbiota and its associated metabolites on OSA risk, thereby providing new insights into the mechanisms of gut microbiome-mediated OSA development."

The diversity and microbiota compositions of the VVS cases and controls were compared with the independent sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between the predominant bacteria and clinical symptoms was analyzed using Pearson or Spearman correlation test. No significant differences in diversity were evident between VVS and controls (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). At the family level, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was significantly higher in VVS children than in controls (median [Q1, Q3]: 22.10% [16.89%, 27.36%] vs. 13.92% [10.31%, 20.18%], Z\u200a=\u200a-2.40, P\u200a<\u200a0.05), and LEfSe analysis revealed Ruminococcaceae as a discriminative feature (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] score\u200a>\u200a4, P\u200a<\u200a0.05).

In this study, we present findings from a secondary interaction analysis of gut microbiota, aging, and inflammatory marker data from a cohort of patients with different diagnoses of severe mental disorders.

We performed 16S rRNA sequencing as well as measurement of telomere length via quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. We applied statistical modeling with logistic regression to test for interaction between gut microbiota and these markers. Our results showed statistically significant interactions between telomere length and gut microbiota pointing to the genus <i>Lachnostridium</i>, which remained significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of MDD even after adjustment for a series of covariates. Although exploratory, these findings show that specific gut microbiota signatures overexpressing <i>Lachnoclostridium</i> and interacting with biological aging could modulate the liability for MDD."

It is becoming possible to treat mental disorders by regulating the composition of the gut microbiota. Bacillus licheniformis is a probiotic used to treat gut diseases through balancing the gut microbiome during lasting years. Considering the role of gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis, this study used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model rats to explore whether Bacillus licheniformis can prevent and treat depression and anxiety. We found that B. licheniformis reduced the depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours of the rats during the CUMS process. Meanwhile, B. licheniformis changed the gut microbiota composition; increased the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon, decreased kynurenine, norepinephrine, and glutamate levels; and increased the tryptophan, dopamine, epinephrine, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. After correlation analysis, we found Parabacteroides, Anaerostipes, Ruminococcus-2, and Blautia showed significant correlation with neurotransmitters and SCFAs, indicating the gut microbiome plays an important role in B. licheniformis reducing depressive-like behaviours. Therefore, this study suggested B. licheniformis may prevent depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours while regulating the gut microbiota composition and increasing the SCFA levels in the colon to alter the levels of the neurotransmitters in the brain. KEY POINTS: \u2022 B. licheniformis reduced depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours induced by the chronic unpredictable mild stress. \u2022 GABA levels in the brain are assonated with B. licheniformis regulating depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours. \u2022 Gut microbiota composition alteration followed by metabolic changes may play a role in the GABA levels increase."

Six weeks later, depressive- and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated for using the OFT, SPT and TST. Glucose intolerance and liver fat were detected by IGTT and liver lipid kit. The expression of peripheral and central inflammation was detected by LEGEND plex kits. 5-HT (also named 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and related receptors expression were monitored by ELISA, RT-PCR and Western blot. Meantime, gut microbe of stool samples was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Similar to CRS model, short-term HCD intervention induced anxiety and depression-like behavior behavioral abnormalities in mice. HCD consumption resulted in significantly increased body weight, liver fat (LDL-C, TC, TG), peripheral inflammation (IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, IL-17A) and neuroinflammation (MCP-1). The concentration of 5-HT increased in the hippocampus, meanwhile, the expression of 5-HT receptor HTR2A was distinct in different regions of the brain tissue. More importantly, we found that compared with the CON diet, HCD induced the decrease of intestinal flora diversity, especially the decrease the relative abundance of Akkermansia_muciniphila, which was statistically significant. Further, Pearson correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia_muciniphila was significantly negatively correlated with the concentration of MCP-1, IL-17A in serum and 5-HT in hippocampus. Therefore, we speculated that the disorder of neuroinflammation induced by HCD consumption promotes depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice through the gut microbe."

The primary objective of this study was to assess the influences exerted by essential oils derived from thyme (<i>Thymus vulgaris</i>) and oregano (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>) via a comprehensive multi-omics approach within a gnotobiotic murine model featuring colonic microbiota acquired from patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our findings demonstrated prebiotic and potential antioxidant effects elicited by these essential oils. We observed a substantial increase in the relative abundance of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus in the gut microbiota, accompanied by higher levels of short-chain fatty acids and a reduction in trimethylamine N-oxide levels and protein oxidation in the plasma. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of the cardiac tissue proteome unveiled an over-representation of pathways related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cardiac contraction. These findings provide compelling evidence of the prebiotic and antioxidant actions of thyme- and oregano-derived essential oils, which extend to cardiac function. These results encourage further investigation into the promising utility of essential oils derived from herbs commonly used in the Mediterranean diet as potential nutraceutical interventions for mitigating chronic diseases linked to CAD and T2DM."

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1% of children and has no cure. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems are common in children with ASD, and although gut microbiota is known to play an important role in ASD through the gut-brain axis, the specific mechanism is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota may participate in the pathogenesis of ASD through immune- and inflammation-mediated pathways. Here, we identified potentially immunogenic epitopes derived from gut microbiota in stool samples from ASD children with and without GI problems and typically developing (TD) children. Candidate gut microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were identified by blast shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from 43 ASD children (19 with and 24 without GI involvement) and 31 sex- and age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Potentially immunogenic epitopes were screened against a predictive human Immune Epitope Database. The composition and abundance of candidate MEs were compared between the three groups of children. MEs identified in ASD children with GI problems were significantly more diverse than those in TD children. ME composition could discriminate between the three groups of children. We identified 34 MEs that were significantly more or less abundant in ASD children than TD children, most (29/34) of the differences in MEs were reduced in ASD and associated with abnormal gut IgA level and altered gut microbiota composition, these MEs were limited effected by clinical factors such as age, gender, and GI problems, of which eleven MEs were pathogenic microorganisms peptides with strong T or B cell response, nine MEs showed high homology to peptides from human self proteins associated with autoimmune disease occurrence, eliciting immune attack against hematopoietic stem cells and inhibition antigen binding. We also found that the abundance of five MEs were increased in ASD, including three human self proteins, gap junction alpha-1 (GJA1), paired box protein Pax-3 (PAX3) and eyes absent homolog 1 isoform 4 (EYA1) which associated with cancer, and a ME with homology to a Listeriolysin O peptide from the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes was significantly increased in ASD children compared with TD children. Our findings demonstrate the abnormal of MEs composition in the gut of children with ASD, moreover, the abnormality in MEs composition was associated with abnormal gut IgA levels and altered gut microbiota composition, this abnormality also suggests that there may be abnormalities in intestinal immunity in children with ASD; In all, thirty-four MEs identified were potential biomarker of ASD, and alterations in MEs may contribute to abnormalities in gut immunity and/or homeostasis in ASD children. Further study of the MEs identified here may advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of ASD."

However, limited information is available on the specific microbial communities associated with symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate gut microbiota dysbiosis and its relationship with psychopathologies in schizophrenia. We recruited 126 participants and divided them into three groups according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria-acute group (patients with acute schizophrenia), remission group (patients with schizophrenia in remission), and control group (healthy controls). Psychotic symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Microbiota compositions, diversity and community structure were evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association between bacterial taxa and psychotic symptoms. The beta-diversity of microbiota composition in the acute group was distinct from that in the remission and control groups (PC1 = 21.11% vs. PC2 = 12.86%, <i>P</i> = 0.021). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that abundance of <i>Haemophilu</i>s was positively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.303, <i>P</i> = 0.021), while abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> was negatively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = -<i>0.285, P</i> = <i>0.025</i>). Moreover, abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> was positively correlated with cognition (<i>r</i> = 0.428, <i>P</i> = 0.009), excitement (<i>r</i> = 0.266, <i>P</i> = 0.037), and depression (<i>r</i> = 0.295, <i>P</i> = 0.020).

The risk factors for post-COVID-19 DGBI included female gender, symptomatic COVID-19, particularly GI symptoms, the severity of COVID-19, the occurrence of anosmia and ageusia, use of antibiotics and hospitalization during the acute illness, persistent GI symptoms beyond 1 month after recovery, presence of mental health factors, The putative mechanisms for post-COVID-19 DGBI include altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, gut microbiota dysbiosis, GI inflammation, and immune activation, changes in intestinal permeability, and alterations in the enteroendocrine system and serotonin metabolism. Long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV2 infection may persist even after recovery from COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop post-COVID-19 IBS than healthy controls.

        "abstract": "With the development of gut microbiota-specific interventions for mental disorders, the interactions between plant polysaccharides and microbiota in the intestinal and their consequent effects are becoming increasingly important. In this review, we discussed the role of plant polysaccharides in improving various mental disorders via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The chemical and structural characteristics and metabolites of these plant polysaccharides were summarised. Plant polysaccharides and their metabolites have great potential for reshaping gut microbiota profiles through gut microbiota-dependent fermentation. Along the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the consequent pharmacological processes that lead to the elimination of the symptoms of mental disorders include 1) regulation of the central monoamine neurotransmitters, amino acid transmitters and cholinergic signalling system; 2) alleviation of central and peripheral inflammation mainly through the NLRP3/NF-\u03baB-related signalling pathway; 3) inhibition of neuronal apoptosis; and 4) enhancement of antioxidant activities. According to this review, monosaccharide glucose and structure -4-\u03b1-Glcp-(1\u2192 are the most potent compositions of the most reported plant polysaccharides. However, the causal structure-activity relationship remains to be extensively explored. Moreover, mechanistic elucidation, safety verification, and additional rigorous human studies are expected to advance plant polysaccharide-based product development targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis for people with mental disorders."

Growing evidence in recent years suggests that the gut microbiome may influence PD, but the exact pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. In addition, the current diagnosis of PD could be inaccurate and expensive. In this study, the largest meta-analysis currently of the gut microbiome in PD was analyzed, including 2269 samples by 16S rRNA gene and 236 samples by shotgun metagenomics, aiming to reveal the connection between PD and gut microbiome and establish a model to predict PD. The results showed that the relative abundances of potential pro-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly increased in PD, while potential anti-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly decreased. These changes may lead to a decrease in potential anti-inflammatory substances (short-chain fatty acids) and an increase in potential pro-inflammatory substances (lipopolysaccharides, hydrogen sulfide and glutamate). Notably, the results of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic analysis have consistently identified five decreased genera (Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Lachnospira, and Prevotella) and five increased genera (Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio) in PD. Furthermore, random forest models performed well for PD prediction based on 11 genera (accuracy > 80%) or 6 genes (accuracy > 90%) related to inflammation. Finally, a possible mechanism was presented to explain the pathogenesis of inflammation leading to PD. Our results provided further insights into the prediction and treatment of PD based on inflammation."

Recently, with the in-depth research of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, gut microbiota has been considered a new approach to maintain and improve psychological health. However, the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes inside long-term closed environments is still poorly understood. Herein, we used the \"Lunar Palace 365\" mission, a 1-year-long isolation study in the Lunar Palace 1 (a closed manned Bioregenerative Life Support System facility with excellent performance), to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes, in order to find some new potential psychobiotics to maintain and improve the psychological health of crew members. We report some altered gut microbiota that were associated with psychological changes in the long-term closed environment. Four potential psychobiotics (Bacteroides uniformis, Roseburia inulinivorans, Eubacterium rectale, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were identified. On the basis of metagenomic, metaproteomic, and metabolomic analyses, the four potential psychobiotics improved mood mainly through three pathways related to nervous system functions: first, by fermenting dietary fibers, they may produce short-chain fatty acids, such as butyric and propionic acids; second, they may regulate amino acid metabolism pathways of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tryptophan, etc. (e.g., converting glutamic acid to gamma-aminobutyric acid; converting tryptophan to serotonin, kynurenic acid, or tryptamine); and third, they may regulate other pathways, such as taurine and cortisol metabolism. Furthermore, the results of animal experiments confirmed the positive regulatory effect and mechanism of these potential psychobiotics on mood. These observations reveal that gut microbiota contributed to a robust effect on the maintenance and improvement of mental health in a long-term closed environment. Our findings represent a key step towards a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian mental health during space flight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew mental health during future long-term human space expeditions on the moon or Mars. This study also provides an essential reference for future applications of psychobiotics to neuropsychiatric treatments. Video Abstract."

In this paper (Leite <i>et al.</i> (2021), Cell Reports, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109765), we demonstrate significant differences in the small intestinal microbiome in older subjects, using duodenal aspirates from 251 subjects aged 18-80 years. Differences included significantly decreased microbial diversity in older subjects, driven by increased relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria, particularly family Enterobacteriaceae and coliform genera <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Klebsiella.</i> Moreover, while this decreased diversity was associated with the 'ageing process' (comprising chronologic age, number of medications, and number of concomitant diseases), changes in certain taxa were found to be associated with number of medications alone (<i>Klebsiella</i>), number of diseases alone (<i>Clostridium, Bilophila</i>), or chronologic age alone (<i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus, Enterococcus</i>). Lastly, many taxa associated with increasing chronologic age were anaerobes. These changes may contribute to changes in human health that occur during the ageing process."

        "abstract": "In response to environmental challenges, stress is a common reaction, but dysregulation of the stress response can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and cognitive impairment. Particularly, there is ample evidence that overexposure to mental stress can have lasting detrimental consequences for psychological health, cognitive function, and ultimately well-being. In fact, some individuals are resilient to the same stressor. A major benefit of enhancing stress resilience in at-risk groups is that it may help prevent the onset of stress-induced mental health problems. A potential therapeutic strategy for maintaining a healthy life is to address stress-induced health problems with botanicals or dietary supplements such as polyphenols. Triphala, also known as Zhe Busong decoction in Tibetan, is a well-recognized <i>Ayurvedic</i> polyherbal medicine comprising dried fruits from three different plant species. As a promising food-sourced phytotherapy, triphala polyphenols have been used throughout history to treat a variety of medical conditions, including brain health maintenance. Nevertheless, a comprehensive review is still lacking. Here, the primary objective of this review article is to provide an overview of the classification, safety, and pharmacokinetics of triphala polyphenols, as well as recommendations for the development of triphala polyphenols as a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting resilience in susceptible individuals. Additionally, we summarize recent advances demonstrating that triphala polyphenols are beneficial to cognitive and psychological resilience by regulating 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptors, gut microbiota, and antioxidant-related signaling pathways. Overall, scientific exploration of triphala polyphenols is warranted to understand their therapeutic efficacy. In addition to providing novel insights into the mechanisms of triphala polyphenols for promoting stress resilience, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and systemic bioavailability of triphala polyphenols also need to be improved by the research community. Moreover, well-designed clinical trials are needed to increase the scientific validity of triphala polyphenols' beneficial effects for preventing and treating cognitive impairment and psychological dysfunction."

Studies have shown that Toll-like receptors, especially Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), are key mediators of gut homeostasis. In addition to their established role in innate immunity throughout the body, research is increasingly showing that the Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways shape the development and function of the gut and enteric nervous system. Notably, Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 are dysregulated in Parkinson's disease patients and may therefore be identified as the core of early gut dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. To better understand the contribution of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 dysfunction in the gut to early \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, we discussed the structural function of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 and signal transduction of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 in Parkinson's disease by reviewing clinical, animal models, and <i>in vitro</i> studies.

Thus, this study analysed published literature on anxiety, depression, and probiotic supplementation from PubMed and Scopus, focusing on the last twenty years. This study focused on the effect of probiotics on mental health as they have drawn more attention because of their extensive clinical applications and positive impact on various diseases. Numerous studies have demonstrated how the gut microbiota might be critical for mood regulation and how probiotics can affect host health by regulating the gut-brain axis.

The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed."

Certainly, China's economic open-ups, improving living standard, and modernization have propagated the surge. From a traditional public-health point of view, increased food intake and decreased exercise were the main contributors. A new knowledge of colon microbiota could be applied to provide a second harvest of food energy; for example, large molecules of carbohydrates, which are undigested by the stomach and small intestine, produce by-products that the body can absorb in the colon. Colon microbiota can ferment these carbohydrates to the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. This is an energy source that may even cause nonalcoholic fatty liver. How these colon microbiota contribute to the surge of diabetes and whether this new knowledge can be used to control diabetes and metabolic syndrome are questions for future scientific studies. Clinically, however, colon microbiota have had immediate applications; fecal microbiota have been transplanted from healthy persons to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection at Mayo Clinic.

Yet, individual responses to such stress vary, with some people developing stress-induced psychopathologies while others exhibit resilience. The factors influencing sex-related disparities in affective disorders as well as variations in resilience remain unclear; however, emerging evidence suggests differences in the gut microbiota play a role. In this study, using the single prolonged stress (SPS) model of post-traumatic stress disorder, we investigated pre- and post-existing differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites that affect stress susceptibility or resilience in each sex. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control or SPS groups. Two weeks following SPS, the animals were exposed to a battery of behavioral tests and decapitated a day later. Based on their anxiety index, they were further categorized as SPS-resilient (SPS-R) or SPS-susceptible (SPS-S). On the day of dissection, cecum, and selected brain tissues were isolated. Stool samples were collected before and after SPS, whereas urine samples were taken before and 30\u00a0min into the SPS. Before SPS exposure, the sympathoadrenal axis exhibited alterations within male subgroups only. Expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 was lower in brain of SPS-S males, but higher in SPS-R females following SPS. Across the study, alpha diversity remained consistently lower in males compared to females. Beta diversity revealed distinct separations between male and female susceptible groups before SPS, with this separation becoming evident in the resilient groups following SPS. At the genus level, Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae_Incertae_Sedis, and Barnesiella exhibited sex-specific alterations, displaying opposing abundances in each sex. Additionally, sex-specific changes were observed in microbial predictive functionality and targeted functional modules both before and after SPS. Alterations in the microbial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also observed, with major and minor SCFAs being lower in SPS-susceptible males whereas branched-chain SCFAs being higher in SPS-susceptible females. This study highlights distinct pre- and post-trauma differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites, associated with stress resilience in male and female rats. The findings underscore the importance of developing sex-specific therapeutic strategies to effectively address stress-related disorders. Highlights SPS model induces divergent anxiety and social behavioral responses to traumatic stress in both male and female rodents. SPS-resilient females displayed less anxiety-like behavior and initiated more interactions towards a juvenile rat than SPS-resilient males. Sex-specific pre-existing and SPS-induced differences in the gut microbial composition and predictive functionality were observed in susceptible and resilient rats. SPS-resilient males displayed elevated cecal acetate levels, whereas SPS-susceptible females exhibited heightened branched-chain SCFAs."

        "abstract": "The emergent recognition of the gut-brain axis connection has shed light on the role of the microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis's functions. Several microbial metabolites, such as serotonin, kynurenine, tryptamine, indole, and their derivatives originating from tryptophan metabolism have been implicated in influencing this axis. In our study, we aimed to investigate the impact of running exercises on microbial tryptophan metabolism using a mouse model. We conducted a multi-omics analysis to obtain a comprehensive insight into the changes in tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced by running exercises. The analyses integrated multiple components, such as tryptophan changes and metabolite levels in the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. Fecal microbiota analysis aimed to examine the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, and taxon-function analysis explored the associations between specific microbial taxa and functional activities in tryptophan metabolism. Our findings revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism across multiple sites, including the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. The outcomes indicate a shift in microbiota diversity and tryptophan metabolizing capabilities within the running group, linked to increased tryptophan transportation to the hippocampus and brainstem through circulation. Moreover, the symbiotic association between <i>Romboutsia</i> and <i>A. muciniphila</i> indicated their potential contribution to modifying the gut microenvironment and influencing tryptophan transport to the hippocampus and brainstem. These findings have potential applications for developing microbiota-based approaches in the context of exercise for neurological diseases, especially on mental health and overall well-being."

        "abstract": "Inflammation is a biological response to the activation of the immune system by various infectious or non-infectious agents, which may lead to tissue damage and various diseases. Gut commensal bacteria maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host and display a critical function in the homeostasis of the host immune system. Disturbance to the gut microbiota leads to immune dysfunction both locally and at distant sites, which causes inflammatory conditions not only in the intestine but also in the other organs such as lungs and brain, and may induce a disease state. Probiotics are well known to reinforce immunity and counteract inflammation by restoring symbiosis within the gut microbiota. As a result, probiotics protect against various diseases, including respiratory infections and neuroinflammatory disorders. A growing body of research supports the beneficial role of probiotics in lung and mental health through modulating the gut-lung and gut-brain axes. In the current paper, we discuss the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of viral respiratory infections, including the COVID-19 disease, as major public health crisis in 2020, and influenza virus infection, as well as treatment of neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and other mental illnesses."

In this randomized, double-blinded, two-arm feasibility study, we investigated whether intermittent fasting, supplemented with <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001 probiotic, reduces HbA1c in individuals with prediabetes. All participants with HbA1c 40-50 mmol/mol commenced intermittent fasting (2 days per week of calorie restriction to 600-650 kcal/day) and were randomized 1:1 to either daily probiotic (<i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometry, body composition, glucoregulatory markers, lipids, hunger hormones, liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, gut hormones, calorie and macronutrient intake, quality of life, hunger, mood and eating behavior. Of 33 participants who commenced the trial, 26 participants (mean age 52 years, body mass index (BMI) 34.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed the intervention (<i>n</i> = 11 placebo, <i>n</i> = 15 probiotic). HbA1c decreased from 43 \u00b1 2.7 mmol/mol to 41 \u00b1 2.3 mmol/mol, <i>p</i> < 0.001, with average of 5% weight loss. No significant between-group differences were seen in primary or secondary outcomes except for social functioning (<i>p</i> = 0.050) and mental health (<i>p</i> = 0.007) scores as improvements were seen in the probiotic group, but not in the placebo group. This study shows additional psychological benefits of probiotic supplementation during intermittent fasting to achieve weight loss and glycemic improvement in prediabetes."

        "abstract": "The highly processed western diet is substituting the low-processed traditional diet in the last decades globally. Increasing research found that a diet with poor quality such as western diet disrupts gut microbiota and increases the susceptibility to various neurological and mental disorders, while a balanced diet regulates gut microbiota and prevents and alleviates the neurological and mental disorders. Yet, there is limited research on the association between the disease burden expanding of neurological and mental disorders with a dietary transition. We compared the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) trend by age for neurological and mental disorders in China, in the United States of America (USA), and across the world from 1990 to 2019, evaluated the dietary transition in the past 60 years, and analyzed the association between the burden trend of the two disorders with the changes in diet composition and food production. We identified an age-related upward pattern in disease burden in China. Compared with the USA and the world, the Chinese neurological and mental disorders DALY percent was least in the generation over 75 but rapidly increased in younger generations and surpassed the USA and/or the world in the last decades. The age-related upward pattern in Chinese disease burdens had not only shown in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus but also appeared in the presence of depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, schizophrenia, headache disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and eating disorders, successively. Additionally, the upward trend was associated with the dramatic dietary transition including a reduction in dietary quality and food production sustainability, during which the younger generation is more affected than the older. Following the increase in total calorie intake, alcohol intake, ratios of animal to vegetal foods, and poultry meat to pulses, the burdens of the above diseases continuously rose. Then, following the rise of the ratios of meat to pulses, eggs to pulses, and pork to pulses, the usage of fertilizers, the farming density of pigs, and the burdens of the above disease except diabetes mellitus were also ever-increasing. Even the usage of pesticides was positively correlated with the burdens of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and neoplasms. Contrary to China, the corresponding burdens of the USA trended to reduce with the improvements in diet quality and food production sustainability. Our results suggest that improving diet quality and food production sustainability might be a promising way to stop the expanding burdens of neurological and mental disorders."

        "abstract": "Recently, an important relationship between Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiota, through the brain-gut axis interactions, has been established. Previous studies have declared that alterations in the gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathogenesis and clinical picture of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to identify the gut microbiome that is likely related to Parkinson's disease as well as their possible relation to clinical phenotypes. Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease, who presented to the Parkinson's disease Neurology Clinic of Alexandria University Hospital were enrolled in our study. A cross-matching control group of 35 healthy subjects of similar age and sex were included. Stool specimens were taken from each. Quantitative SYBR Green Real-Time PCR was done for the identification and quantitation of selected bacterial phyla, genera and/or species. There was a significant increase in Bacteroides and a significant decrease of Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio and Bifidobacteria in PD patients. Although Prevotella was decreased among PD patients relative to the healthy control, the difference was not statistically significant. Comparing the PD clinical phenotypes with the control group, the Mixed phenotype had significantly higher Bacteroides, Tremors predominant had lower Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio, and both tremors and postural instability and gait disability (PIGD) phenotypes had lower Bifidobacteria. However, there was no statistically significant difference between these phenotypes. Furthermore, when comparing tremors and non-tremors predominant phenotypes; Lactobacilli showed a significant decrease in non-tremors predominant phenotypes. The current study showed evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's disease patients compared to the healthy controls. These observations may highlight the importance of the identification of microbiome and specific bacterial changes that can be targeted for the treatment of Parkinson's disease."

        "abstract": "Dysfunctional processing of fear memory may be involved in the pathophysiology of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), which is cited as the major unmet psychological need of cancer survivors. Emerging evidence has shown that the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis affects depressive and anxiety disorders, and chemotherapy-associated psychological distress. We therefore hypothesized that the gut microbiota is associated with FCR in cancer survivors. This cross-sectional study enrolled women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer who were not currently undergoing chemotherapy. Fecal samples were obtained to assess the gut microbiota. FCR grade was assessed using the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (CARS). Mean age of the participants (n\u202f=\u202f126) was 58\u202fyears; 47% had stage I disease. Multiple regression analysis with adjustment for possible confounders showed that the relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus (beta\u202f=\u202f0.180, p\u202f=\u202f0.03) was significantly and directly associated with FCR. In the 57 participants with a history of chemotherapy, higher FCR was associated with lower microbial diversity (p\u202f=\u202f0.04), lower relative abundance of Firmicutes (p\u202f=\u202f0.03) and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (p\u202f=\u202f0.04) at the phylum level, and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae.g (p\u202f=\u202f0.03) and Ruminococcus (p\u202f=\u202f0.02) at the genus level. Our findings provide the first evidence of an association between the gut microbiota and FCR and suggest that chemotherapy-induced changes in gut microbiota can influence FCR. Further studies should examine the effects of the gut microbiota on FCR using a prospective design."

A total of 45 patients with first-episode depression and 22 healthy volunteers were chosen to complete relevant scale evaluations, and feces samples and venous blood samples were collected. The 16S RNA method was used to analyze the intestinal microflora and the characteristics of serum SCFAs detection by ELISA kit, as well as the intestinal flora, SCFAs content and their correlation with MDD clinical indicators. The abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae NK3B31 group</i>, and butyrate-producing bacteria, <i>Lachnospira</i>, <i>Subdoligranulum</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Dialister</i>, and acetate-producing bacteria, <i>Streptococcus</i>, in the gut microbiota of the MDD group was lower than that in the control (C) group. The abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i> in the MDD group was higher than that in the C group. <i>Dialister</i> negatively correlated with all measured clinical symptoms (<i>r</i> < 0, <i>P</i> < 0.05). The serum SCFA content in the MDD group was higher than that in the C group, and the content positively correlated with the Hamilton anxiety scale scores (<i>r</i> = 0.584, <i>P</i> < 0.05). The results demonstrated that the MDD group differed from the C group in terms of gut microbiota and SCFAs in the serum and that the change in certain intestinal bacteria might participate in the pathogenic mechanism of MDD."
