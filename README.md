# GutBrainIE Baselines & Evaluation

This repository provides the complete pipeline for the baseline implementation and evaluation for the [GutBrainIE](https://hereditary.dei.unipd.it/challenges/gutbrainie/2025/) challenge – the sixth task of the [BioASQ](https://www.bioasq.org/) Lab @ [CLEF 25](https://clef2025.clef-initiative.eu/). We employ [GLiNER (NuNerZero)](https://huggingface.co/numind/NuNER_Zero) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and [ATLOP](https://github.com/wzhouad/ATLOP) for Relation Extraction (RE).

Users have three main options:
- **Reproduce the baseline from scratch:** Run the entire pipeline — including data processing, training, prediction generation, and evaluation.
- **Test with pre-trained models:** Directly import our fine-tuned models for generating and evaluating predictions.
- **Evaluate provided outputs:** Use the supplied model outputs and directly run the evaluation as detailed in the TL;DR section.

Evaluation results on the dev set and on all of the training sets, along with detailed explanations of the employed evaluation metrics, are available at the [CHALLENGE WEBSITE](https://hereditary.dei.unipd.it/challenges/gutbrainie/2025/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Dataset Setup**: Replace the empty `Annotations` and `Articles` folders with the corresponding GutBrainIE dataset folders.

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)
1. **Evaluate Baseline Predictions:**
   - Execute the script `Eval/evaluate.py` to generate evaluation results.
   - This step will evaluate the baseline predictions on the dev set contained in `Eval/org_*`.
2. **Evaluate Your Predictions:**
   - Format your predictions in the submission format, as the files `Eval/org_*`.
   - Open the script `Eval/evaluate.py` and adjust the paths to point to your prediction files.
   - Execute the script `Eval/evaluate.py` to generate evaluation results.

## Data Preparation and Training

### Data Conversion

Before training, convert your annotations into the required formats:

- **NER Conversion:**  
  Run [`Utils/annotations_to_gliner_format.ipynb`](Utils/annotations_to_gliner_format.ipynb) to convert annotations for GLiNER. This produces data in `Train/NER/data`.

- **RE Conversion:**  
  Run [`Utils/annotations_to_atlop_format.ipynb`](Utils/annotations_to_atlop_format.ipynb) to convert annotations for ATLOP. This produces data in `Train/RE/data`.

### NER Fine-tuning

1. **Configure Training:**  
   Navigate to `Train/NER` and open `gliner_interface.py`. Adjust the following as needed:
   - Pre-trained model selection.
   - Confidence threshold for evaluation.
   - Flags for training vs. prediction.
   - Choice of training sets (platinum, gold, silver), training/evaluation steps, batch size, etc.

2. **Run Fine-tuning:**  
   Execute `gliner_interface.py`. If running on Windows, you need to launch that command while executing powershell in administrator mode.
   - **Outputs:**  
     - Evaluation checkpoints are saved in `Train/NER/logs`.
     - The final fine-tuned model is stored in `Train/NER/outputs`.

### RE Training

1. **Prepare Training Data:**  
   In `Train/RE`, open and run `compose_training_sets.py` to decide which sets are “manually annotated” and which are “distantly annotated.”  
   - This script produces:
     - `Train/RE/data/train_annotated.json`
     - `Train/RE/data/train_distant.json`

2. **Configuration Check:**  
   Ensure that the number of relations in `Train/RE/data/meta/rel2id.json` match the `num_class` parameter in `atlop_finetune.sh` and that all the relations in your training set are included.

3. **Run Fine-tuning:**  
   Optionally adjust training parameters in `atlop_finetune.sh` and then run the script to fine-tune ATLOP. If running on Windows, you might need to replace the backslash (\) characters used for multi-line prompting with the backtick (\`) character and paste the command directly into powershell executed in administrator mode.

## Generating Predictions

### NER Predictions

1. **Generate Predictions:**  
   In `Train/NER`, set the `generate_predictions` flag to `True` in `gliner_interface.py` and run the script.  
   - The predictions are saved as `Predictions/NER/predicted_entities.json`.

2. **Convert Predictions:**  
   - Run [`Utils/NER_predictions_to_evaluation_format.ipynb`](Utils/NER_predictions_to_evaluation_format.ipynb) to convert GLiNER predictions into evaluation format, producing `Predictions/NER/predicted_entities_eval_format.json`.
   - Next, run [`Utils/NER_predictions_to_atlop_format.ipynb`](Utils/NER_predictions_to_atlop_format.ipynb) to convert these into the ATLOP format, saving the file in `Train/RE/data/predicted_entities_atlop_format.json`.

### RE Predictions

1. **Generate Predictions:**  
   Navigate to `Train/RE` and run `atlop_generate_predictions.sh`. This loads your trained ATLOP model (as configured in the script) and outputs predictions to `Predictions/RE/predicted_relations.json`. 

    If running on Windows, you might need to replace the backslash (\\) characters used for multi-line prompting with the backtick (\`) character and paste the command directly into powershell executed in administrator mode. 
    
    If not done automatically by the script, move the `Train/RE/outputs/results.json` file produced in output to `Predictions/RE/predicted_relations.json`.

2. **Merge Predictions:**  
   Run [`Utils/merge_predictions_to_evaluation_format.ipynb`](Utils/merge_predictions_to_evaluation_format.ipynb) to combine the NER and RE outputs into the evaluation files `Predictions/predictions_eval_format.json`, `Eval/teamID_T61_runID_systemDesc.json`, `Eval/teamID_T621_runID_systemDesc.json`, `Eval/teamID_T622_runID_systemDesc.json`, `Eval/teamID_T623_runID_systemDesc.json`.

---

## Evaluation

With the merged predictions in `Eval/**.json`, navigate into `Eval/` and run:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This script calculates evaluation metrics for all subtasks. 
To test your own results, place them in the `Eval` folder, adjust the paths in `evaluate.py`, and run the script.

## Using Pre-trained Models

If you prefer to bypass the fine-tuning phase, you can download and use our pre-trained models.

### Importing the GLiNER Model

2. **Setup:**  
   Unzip and place the folder content in `Train/NER/outputs` and adjust the `model path` variable in `gliner_interface.py`.
3. **Generate Predictions:**  
   Run `gliner_interface.py` to produce NER predictions by setting the flags `finetune_model` to False and `generate_predictions` to True.
